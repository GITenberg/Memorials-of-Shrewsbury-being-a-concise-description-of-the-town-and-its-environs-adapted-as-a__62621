v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>A little Manual adapted to assist the enquiring stranger in
his perambulation around Shrewsbury having been long required, an
ardent attachment to his native place, and compliance with the
wishes of many friends whose opinions demand respect, are
circumstances that have induced the present writer to undertake
the task, in which he has been materially assisted by the
possession of several volumes of <span class="smcap">Salopian
Annals</span>, or memoranda of all the principal events that have
occurred in the town for several past years, the collection
whereof has afforded him a pleasing recreation in those scraps of
time snatched from active professional avocations&mdash;periods
wherein every one has his favourite pursuit, and in which any
individual may, by prudently employing them for his own pleasure,
not unfrequently render himself useful to others.</p>
<p>It may be further stated that the present design is purely
patriotic; and whilst no expence has been spared in the numerous
embellishments, candour and truth (combined with accuracy and
conciseness) have been carefully observed throughout a more
extensive field of local information and graphical illustration
than has heretofore been cultivated in any previous work adapted
as a Guide through the Metropolis of Shropshire,&mdash;many
subjects being now classified and brought under general notice
for the first time.</p>
<p>The Author would therefore hope that the <span
class="smcap">Memorials of Shrewsbury</span> will be found to
afford a comprehensive and faithful illustration to the stranger
of whatever may be important in this ancient and beautifully
situated town, as well as useful and deserving the confidence of
his fellow-townsmen in particular, to whom he offers them (to use
the words of our great lexicographer) &ldquo;in the spirit of a
man that has endeavoured well,&rdquo; and with the utmost
sincerity for the best interests of his native place.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Town of <span
class="smcap">Shrewsbury</span> stands nearly in the centre of
the county of which it is the capital; it is situated on two
gentle declivities, and is formed by the river Severn into a
peninsula, somewhat in the shape of a horse-shoe, having an
isthmus not more than three hundred yards across.</p>
<p>A variety of opinions have prevailed as to who made choice of
the commanding situation and natural retreat which the town
affords, as well as to the period of its foundation.</p>
<p>It has been stated to be of far prior date than the ancient
Uriconium (the present Wroxeter), from the circumstances that it
was the custom of the Romans to throw up stations, and to make
roads parallel or adjacent to British camps.&nbsp; One thing
however is certain, that no vestige of that imperial people has
been discovered within its precinct.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The truth
is conceived to be, that Shrewsbury was occupied or built some
time in the fifth century, after the destruction of the Roman
Uriconium, as a place where the fugitive Britons might find an
asylum from the devastations of their Saxon invaders.</p>
<h2>ETYMOLOGY.</h2>
<p>The Britons gave the place the appellation of <i>Pengwern</i>,
the Saxons <i>Scrobbes-byrig</i>; both are synonymous, importing
a fenced eminence covered with shrubs.&nbsp; The ancient Welsh
called it, and do so to this day, <i>Ammwythig</i>, signifying
&ldquo;The Delight.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Normans
<i>Sciropesberie</i>, and subsequently <i>Salopesberie</i> and
<i>Schrosbury</i>, from whence is formed its present name
Shrewsbury and Salop.&nbsp; The antiquary Leland thus beautifully
accounts for its name:</p>
<blockquote><p>Edita Pengwerni late fastigia splendent,<br />
Urbs sita lunato veluti mediamnis in orbe,<br />
Colle tumet modico; duplici quoque ponte superbit:<br />
Accipiens patria sibi lingua nomen ab alnis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which may be thus translated&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Built on a hill, fair <span
class="smcap">Salop</span> greets the eye,<br />
While Severn like an eel curves gliding by:<br />
Two bridges cross the bark-conveying stream,<br />
And British alders gave the town a name.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>ANCIENT HISTORY.</h2>
<p>When the Britons had become somewhat settled in their new
possessions, they built themselves a city, which (as has been
already stated) was called <i>Pengwern</i>.&nbsp; After its
destruction under Cynddylan, we find Pengwern inhabited <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>by a King of
Powis,&mdash;the capital of his kingdom, and ranking among the
twenty-eight cities of Britain.</p>
<p>Brochwel Yscithrog, or the tusked, King of Powis, whom the
Saxon Chronicle calls the Earlderman of the Britons, retained
possession of a great part of Shropshire, and fixed his residence
in Pengwern, about 617; his palace being where the ruins of Old
St. Chad&rsquo;s Church now stand.</p>
<p>Eliseg, his sixth descendant, recovered the portion of his
&ldquo;inheritance of Powis&rdquo; from the Saxons, by the sword,
during the reign of the Mercian King Offa, which continued from
755 to 794, but being unable to maintain it, he surrendered by
treaty to the Saxons, whereby Pengwern lost the dignity of a
metropolis.</p>
<p>Of the state of our town under its native princes we have no
information: the arts of civil life, in which the Britons had
improved, under their Roman masters, were probably lost during
the almost constant warfare of three centuries.&nbsp; This we may
reasonably conclude was the case, from the appellation given to
it by the new possessors, <i>Scrobbes-byrig</i>, a fenced
eminence, but overgrown with shrubs.</p>
<p>Nothing is related of the town during the period it formed a
portion of the Mercian territory, though the place doubtless
experienced the many revolutions of that kingdom.</p>
<p>In the reign of Alfred, Scrobbes-byrig was numbered among the
principal cities of Britain.&nbsp; Ethelred the Unready, having
been pursued by the Danes, kept his Christmas here in 1006, and
in the next year resigned the government of Mercia unto his
son-in-law &AElig;dric, who made this town his occasional his
occasional residence.</p>
<p>Under the Saxon monarchs the town must have been of importance
to possess the privilege of a mint, which it <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>retained for a
considerable period, many coins of which are extant.</p>
<p>&AElig;dric Sylvaticus, or the Forester, in conjunction with
Owen Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales, laid siege to the town in
1068; but William the First sending two earls to the relief of
the castle, the rebels burned a portion of the town and withdrew:
the king however speedily revenged the insult with much
slaughter.</p>
<p>The Saxons were removed from all places of trust by the Norman
Conqueror, who rewarded his principal adherents with portions of
their lands.&nbsp; He conferred upon his kinsman, Roger de
Montgomery, the earldom of Shrewsbury, to which he added a grant
of the town and ample domains in the county.</p>
<p>In 1138, the nation being divided as to Stephen&rsquo;s right
to the crown, that monarch laid siege to the castle.&nbsp; Fitz
Alan, the governor, favouring the Empress Maud, fled, and
Stephen, who had conducted the siege in his own person, was so
exasperated at the obstinacy of the besieged, who resolutely held
out nearly four weeks, that he put ninety-three of them to an
ignominious death.</p>
<p>From the border situation of Shrewsbury to a hostile country,
it was considered of much importance to our early monarchs, and
consequently became the scene of many a negotiation and contest
with the Welsh, whose frequent incursions were most
harassing.</p>
<p>The Princes of North Wales having been long uneasy neighbours
to the Kings of England, John thought it expedient to hold a
council here to make a treaty with Llewelyn the Great, the then
Prince of Wales.&nbsp; In the year 1202 the king gave Llewelyn
his natural daughter Joanna in marriage; and, as if in gratitude
to his father-in-law, he soon recommenced hostilities against
him, and marched with a numerous body of his vigorous subjects <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>from the
Cambrian wilds to Shrewsbury, which he succeeded in taking
without much resistance.</p>
<p>The town, however, did not long continue under the subjection
or possession of its new masters, they being dispossessed by
Henry III. who on more than one occasion kept his court here.</p>
<p>In 1234, Richard, Earl Marescall, being told that Henry
intended to seize him when he repaired to parliament, fled to
Llewelyn, and they both appeared before Shrewsbury with a
powerful army, and burned part of the suburb of Frankwell,
returning to the mountains laden with the spoil of the
inhabitants, many of whom they had barbarously murdered.</p>
<p>Henry III. with his forces again marched to Shrewsbury in
1241, where he remained a fortnight, when David relinquished all
lands Llewelyn had seized from the late king in the war between
him and his barons.</p>
<p>In 1256, Henry, wishing probably to attach himself in the
favour of the burgesses, in order to make their town a bulwark
against Wales, granted them two new charters on the same day; he
likewise summoned his army here; and in 1260 great activity was
evinced in fortifying the town, in consequence of a rupture which
was speedily expected from the aggression of the Welsh
Prince.</p>
<p>Edward the First resided here in 1277, whither he transferred
some of the supreme courts of justice.&nbsp; In 1282 David joined
Llewelyn, who again took up arms, which compelled Edward to
return to Shrewsbury with his courts, where he had assembled his
army, which remained some months.</p>
<p>David, the last of the princes of the Ancient Britons, having
at length become a prisoner in the hands of Edward in 1283, was
sent in chains to Shrewsbury, where a parliament <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>was assembled
to meet Sept. 30th, being &ldquo;<i>the first national convention
in which the Commons had any share by legal
authority</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twenty cities and towns, Shrewsbury
being one, were directed to send two deputies, and every high
sheriff to send two knights.&nbsp; It is supposed they met in the
chapter house, or refectory of the abbey, where David was tried
and cruelly condemned to be dragged at a horse&rsquo;s tail
through the streets of Shrewsbury, and to be afterwards hung and
cut down while alive, his heart and bowels burnt before his face,
his body quartered, and his head sent to London to accompany that
of his brother Llewelyn.</p>
<p>Revenge, it may be said, is sweet; but how often does it occur
that the gratification of resentment over a fallen enemy
transmits his encomium to posterity.</p>
<p>The town, being strongly fenced, was visited by Edward in
1322, where he was honourably received by the inhabitants, who
went out to meet him clad in armour; he continued here for
several days, about which time many of the nobility had assembled
to witness a grand tournament.</p>
<p>Richard II. Jan. 29th, 1397&ndash;8, adjourned his parliament
from Westminster to Shrewsbury, which was denominated the
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Great Parliament</span>,&rdquo; from
the important state affairs which were transacted in it.&nbsp;
The cross of Canterbury was brought here, upon which the lords
spiritual and temporal were sworn to observe and keep all the
statutes which were then made.&nbsp; Chester was on this occasion
made a principality, and several oppressive laws enacted, which
afterwards formed some of the accusations against Richard by
Henry of Bolingbroke, when he usurped the throne.</p>
<p>The revolution which placed Henry of Lancaster on the throne
seems to have met the approbation of the inhabitants; for when
the Duke ostensibly proceeded into Wales to please Richard, he
was nobly received here.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>After the
death of Richard, Owen Glendower, concerning whose birth the muse
of Shakespeare says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The frame and foundation of the earth<br />
Shak&rsquo;d like a coward&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>asserted his pretensions to the two ancient principalities of
North Wales and Powis, and pursued his claim with undaunted
courage, added to a strong resentment for the contumely with
which his demands, public and private, had been treated by the
successor of the unfortunate Richard, to whom he was a firm and
unshaken friend.&nbsp; On the 20th of September, 1400, he boldly
caused himself to be proclaimed Prince of Wales, and infested the
Marches with a strong body of Welshmen, who maintained a warfare
against the governing authorities.&nbsp; In this he was
subsequently supported by the Earl of Northumberland, headed by
his son, the valiant Henry Percy, surnamed Hotspur, who being
assisted by the Earl of Worcester and a numerous force of
Scottish troops under the command of Earl Douglas, agreed to meet
Glendower at Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Henry, being made acquainted with
their movements, hastened with all speed to secure this important
town, and arrived here July 21st, 1403, just in time to hoist his
banner on the walls, and thereby secure the stability of his
crown, having but a few hours&rsquo; march of Percy and his
advanced guard.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 22d, the memorable <span
class="smcap">Battle of Shrewsbury</span> commenced; the
skirmishing began under the walls of the Castle Gates, but the
principal scene of action was about three miles distant, at a
place called <span class="smcap">Battlefield</span>.&nbsp; The
armies on both sides amounted, it is said, to 40,000, and the
contest was severe and sanguinary.&nbsp; Fate, however, decided
that the efforts of Henry against this powerful faction should be
victorious&mdash;a faction, which, having contributed to place
him on the seat of <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>government, now sought to dethrone him.&nbsp; The king is
recorded to have fought with an ardour worthy the crown he was
defending, and the spear of his warlike son, the future hero of
Agincourt, did wonders.&nbsp; In fact it was one of the most
decisive battles recorded in early English history.</p>
<p>Upwards of 2000 nobles, knights, and gentlemen, and 6000
private soldiers, are said to have fallen in the engagement.</p>
<p>Most of the dead bodies were buried on the spot, over whom
Henry, in gratitude for his victory, piously erected a college of
secular canons to pray for the souls of the slain.&nbsp; The more
distinguished were interred in the Dominican and Augustine
Friaries of the town.</p>
<p>The gallant Hotspur was discovered among the slain covered
with wounds, and dispatched to Shrewsbury, where Henry satiated
his revenge by the ignominy of dismembering the lifeless remains,
the head and quarters of which were exhibited over the gate at
York, and afterwards delivered to his wife for interment.&nbsp;
The Earl of Worcester, Sir Richard Vernon, &amp;c. were
beheaded.</p>
<p>Shakspeare, in his Henry the Fourth, has given vividness and
immortality to this battle, and humourously peopled it with
heroes of the most fanciful description.</p>
<p>The Cambrian chieftain, Glendower, with an army of 12,000 men,
marched as far as Oswestry, and was by some means unable to
arrive in time to join in the action; for had he reached ere the
king&rsquo;s forces were victorious, the result might have
terminated very differently for the king and his valiant
son.&nbsp; Gough states a tradition, that Glendower proceeded to
Shelton, and ascended a lofty oak (the trunk of which is still
remaining near the Oswestry road), from whence he might
reconnoitre and gain the earliest intelligence of the event of
the battle.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The royal
blood of this noble Welshman was in no respect chilled by the
defeat of his confederates, for in the next year he carried his
ravages even to the gates of the Welsh Bridge, destroying much of
the suburb of Frankwell and several townships in the
vicinity.</p>
<p>In 1460, Edward IV. marched with an army of 23,000 men from
this town to the battle of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross, and he chose
this place for the residence of his queen, where she was
delivered of her second and third sons, Richard and George
Plantagenet.</p>
<p>On the landing of the Earl of Richmond, afterwards King Henry
the Seventh, at Milford Haven, in August, 1485, he determined to
march for Shrewsbury.&nbsp; On his arriving at the Welsh Bridge
he found the place in a posture of defence, the gates closed
against him, and the bailiffs within ready to give their
answer.&nbsp; On his demanding admittance as their rightful king,
a curious MS. records that the chief bailiff, Thomas Mytton,
replied&mdash;&ldquo;He knew no king but Richard, whose bailiffs
he and his fellow were, upon which he swore that the earl should
not enter there but over his belly.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this,
Richmond returned and passed the night at Forton Heath, where his
army was encamped.&nbsp; He, however, succeeded the next morning;
and Mr. Mytton, in order to conform with the letter of his oath,
laid himself down on the ground, and permitted the earl to step
over him, whereupon the portcullis of the bridge was drawn up,
and the earl with his retinue were admitted, to the general joy
of the inhabitants, notwithstanding it went <i>against the
stomach</i> of the &ldquo;stoute wyse gentilman, Maister
Myttoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Shrewsbury Richmond was first proclaimed king, and raised
soldiers, but left the bailiffs to pay them.&nbsp; He lodged in a
house on the Wyle Cop (three doors below the Lion Inn), from
whence he marched to Bosworth Field, <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>where the engagement took place which
deprived Richard III. of his throne and his life.</p>
<p>Henry VII. visited the town in 1490, with his queen, and son
(Prince Arthur), and kept the feast of St. George in the
collegiate church of St. Chad; they made another visit in 1495,
and were sumptuously entertained by the corporation.</p>
<p>At the general dissolution of monasteries, in 1539, it appears
to have been the intention of Henry VIII. to form thirteen new
bishopricks, <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> one of which was to have been at
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Browne Willis states that John Boucher, Abbot
of Leicester, was actually nominated &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Bishop of Shrewsbury</span>;&rdquo;&mdash;hence the
tradition, as our historians remark, so gratifying to the pride
of every true Salopian, that their forefathers had the offer of
having their borough converted into a city, but that they
preferred inhabiting the <span class="GutSmall">FIRST OF
TOWNS</span>.</p>
<p>1551.&nbsp; The spring of this year was fatally distinguished
by the commencement of a dreadful epidemic in this town, called
the &ldquo;sweating sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Henry Sidney,
President of Wales and Lord Deputy of Ireland, visited this town
almost annually, and was always received with the highest
respect; his celebrated son, Sir Philip, was educated at our Free
Schools.&nbsp; Sir Henry, as Knight of the Garter, kept the feast
of St. George here, in 1581, with great splendour.&nbsp; He
marched in state from his residence, the Council House, to St.
Chad&rsquo;s Church, the stalls of which were decorated with the
arms of the knights, divine service being &ldquo;sung by
note.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 1st of May, the four masters of the
schools entertained his lordship with a costly <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>banquet, and
on the following day three hundred and sixty of the scholars
assembled in the &ldquo;Gay,&rdquo; several of whom addressed him
in speeches.&nbsp; He departed on the 8th, by water,
&ldquo;taking his bardge under the Castle,&rdquo; when another
pageant took place on the island near the Horse Ferry.</p>
<p>Shrewsbury was a favourite retreat for Charles I. during the
troublous period of his reign, and he was frequently received by
the inhabitants with every feeling of loyalty and
attachment.&nbsp; He established a mint here, and kept his court
at the Council House.&nbsp; In the year 1642, he drew up his army
on a spot afterwards called the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Soldier&rsquo;s Piece</span>,&rdquo; and which is
now used as a race ground, where he delivered an harangue to them
and the chief gentlemen of the county, who had in his time of
need rendered him pecuniary assistance and service.</p>
<p>The town was taken by storm in 1644&ndash;5, under the command
of Colonels Mytton and Bowyer, of the parliamentary army, the
inhabitants experiencing all the vicissitudes of a siege, in the
plunder of their goods and destruction of property.&nbsp; An
attempt was made, in 1654, to surprise it, in favour of the
restoration of monarchy, by Sir Thomas Harries, but the scheme,
although deeply planned, was frustrated.</p>
<p>James II. in the month of August, 1687, kept his Court at the
Council House, and was attended by many of the nobility and
gentry of the county, on which occasion, it is said, &ldquo;the
conduits ran with wine,&rdquo; and other most liberal
entertainments and rejoicings welcomed the royal guest.&nbsp; At
the same time he graciously received a purse of one hundred
guineas, which was presented to him by the munificence of the
corporation.</p>
<p>The inhabitants on many occasions have been thus foremost to
testify loyalty to their sovereign.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>In 1715
their adherence to the House of Hanover was strongly manifested
by voluntarily raising a body of horse and foot for the
protection of the town, and placing the walls and gates (then
entire) in a position of defence.</p>
<p>At the time also apprehensions were entertained of the
Pretender and the Scottish invasion in 1745, a regiment of foot
was raised here for the service of government; and, subsequently,
a militia and cavalry have been embodied.</p>
<p>In the year 1832, the most lively enthusiasm was displayed on
the entrance into Shrewsbury of Her Royal Highness the Duchess of
Kent and the Princess Victoria, heir presumptive to the British
throne.</p>
<p>From the foregoing cursory glance given to the leading events
of our ancient history, it may be necessary to remark that it
would have been less difficult to the writer could he have
extended his observations as to particular occurrences; but the
nature of the work being a notice of the <i>present</i> rather
than of the <i>past</i> state of the place, brevity of
description in this, as in some other portions, will be
indispensible.</p>
<p>But the numerous features of historical and antiquarian
interest which the town affords, its <span

state, the destiny of its <span class="smcap">Norman
Earls</span>, its <span class="smcap">Siege by Stephen</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Union of Wales</span> to the English
Crown, the Formation of Parliaments, the <span

Entrance and <span class="smcap">Proclamation of Henry</span>
VII. the Commencement of the <span class="smcap">Civil War</span>
in the Time of Charles I. and Meetings of the <span
class="smcap">Council of the Marches of Wales</span>, while
forming constituent parts of our national story, are especially
connected with this town, and will be found amply detailed in the
valuable History of Shrewsbury published by the late Reverend
Messrs. Owen and Blakeway, where everything difficult in civil
and ecclesiastical localities <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>is explained in a scientific and
masterly manner, and with the greatest discrimination.</p>
<h2>THE CASTLE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But time * * *<br />
Has seen this ruin&rsquo;d pile complete,<br />
Big with the vanity of state.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Dyer</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The civil history of the town being somewhat connected with
the Castle, a notice of that edifice will properly occupy this
place.</p>
<p>After the Earldom of Shrewsbury had been given by William the
Conqueror to Roger de Montgomery, one of his first works was the
building of a stately Castle, or, rather, the enlargement of a
previous one, which it is certain existed here anterior to the
Norman Conquest, on that narrow isthmus where the town is
undefended by the river.</p>
<p>This is supposed to have taken place about the year 1070, on a
site previously occupied by fifty-one houses, and was a measure
of necessity, in order to restrain the hostile incursions of the
Welsh, to which the town, from its situation near the borders,
was frequently exposed; and having probably received injury from
the siege two <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>years previous, and being also limited in size, was
inadequate to the dignity of a wealthy earl, who enjoyed the
feudal supremacy of nearly the whole of Shropshire.</p>
<p>The Castle, in succession, was possessed by the two sons of
the founder, until the reign of Henry I. when it became a royal
fortress, under the custody of a constable.</p>
<p>Edward I. introduced a new style of castellated architecture;
the stronger portion, therefore, now remaining was probably
erected by direction of that monarch, being in the style
generally adopted during his reign.</p>
<p>On the union of Wales it was no longer important as a place of
defence, and the building began gradually to decay, although in
the civil war it was repaired and garrisoned for the king, and
afterwards escaped the almost general demolition of royal
fortresses by its surrender to the parliamentary army in
1645.</p>
<p>The Castle subsequently reverted to the burgesses, who
resigned it to Charles II. and that monarch presented it to Lord
Newport.&nbsp; It is now the property of the Duke of Cleveland,
and is occupied by J. C. Pelham, Esq. one of the members for the
borough.</p>
<p>The present remains have a picturesque effect, and are
composed of a deep red stone.&nbsp; They consist of the keep, the
walls of the inner court, and the great semi-circular arch of</p>
<h3>THE INTERIOR GATEWAY,</h3>
<p>from which the last Norman Earl of Shrewsbury issued with the
keys of the gates to make submission to Henry I.&nbsp; Although
the masonry of the jambs of this noble gateway is singularly
irregular, it has, through a period of nearly 800 years, retained
its strength unshaken amid the ravages of time and war.&nbsp; It
was formerly defended by a portcullis and towers.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>The
keep consists of two large round towers, embattled and pierced,
connected by a square building of about 100 feet in length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p15b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Gateway of Castle"
title=
"Gateway of Castle"
 src="images/p15s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The interior is much altered from its original appearance, and
now forms a handsome private residence, modern pointed windows
having been placed therein when it was repaired by Sir William
Pulteney, about the close of the last century.&nbsp; The drawing
room is supposed to have been <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the guard chamber in the time of
Charles I.&nbsp; The castle still retains one mark of its ancient
dignity, for in the area of the inner court the knights of the
shire are nominated, and when the result of the election is
declared, are girt with their swords by the Sheriff.&nbsp; On the
north-east side of this court is a postern, built in the time of
Charles I.; and the battlements of the western wall have an
interior platform, and are curiously pierced with narrow eyelets
for the convenience of the cross-bowmen, around which time has
wove its ivy mantling.</p>
<p>On the south side within the court is a mount, <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a> rising upwards of 100 feet above the
bed of the river.&nbsp; The summit is surrounded by a wall, and
crowned by a watch tower, which forms a bold and beautiful
object.&nbsp; The tower was rebuilt during the repair of the
castle, from a design and under the superintendance of the late
Thomas Telford, Esq. who was then residing with Sir William
Pulteney.&nbsp; In this elevated tower Mr. Telford wrote the
beautiful poem to his countryman Burns, and thus alludes to its
site near the river Severn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>No distant Swiss with warmer glow<br />
E&rsquo;er heard his native music flow,<br />
Nor could his wishes stronger grow<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Than still have mine;<br />
When up this ancient mount I go<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With songs of thine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sides of the mount are richly planted, and the summit
commands a view of unrivalled beauty, with the most extensive
amphitheatre of mountains of which perhaps the island can boast,
inclosing within its wide sweep an eminently fertile, finely
wooded, and beautifully diversified champagne country.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis here that, after the eye has wandered from object to
object, from the foreground to the most <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>extreme
distance with delight, that the words of <i>Cowper</i> naturally
occur, as if written upon such as spot&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, scene surpassing fable, and yet
true!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is now difficult to form an adequate idea of the original
extent of this fortress; but it is certain that the castle
formerly occupied a much larger space than is now marked out by
its walls, the ballium (or outer court) extending within the town
probably as far as the water-lane.&nbsp; The northern and north
eastern sides were defended by a deep ditch or vallum
encompassing the base of the bold and natural elevation on which
the castle stands, having a communication with the river, but it
is now filled up and forms a thoroughfare.</p>
<p>The remains of a duplicate rampart is distinguishable on the
western side; and other outworks and towers might have stood near
the front of the present county gaol, the Severn being a
protection towards the east.</p>
<blockquote><p>In auncient tyme our elders had desire,<br />
To buyld their townes on steepe and stately hill;<br />
To shewe that as their hearts did still aspyre,<br />
So should their works declare their worthie will.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Churchyard</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>THE FEUDAL STATE</h2>
<p>of Shrewsbury carries with it associations of imposing
importance;&mdash;seated upon a hill rising from a noble ambient
river, it was thus doubly fortified by nature; while art, with <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>no unsparing
hand, had raised an almost impregnable rampart of stone, flanked
by many towers and gates. <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>The imagination will thus readily picture <span
class="smcap">Caer Pengwern</span>: the woody eminence, with its
curiously wrought buildings and domestic mansions ranged in
irregular groups, surmounted by lofty spires and embattled
turrets, irradiated by the effulgence of the meridian sun, or
catching the last smiles of his departing ray,&mdash;a commanding
castle on the narrow isthmus, with its stately towers and
formidable walls, frowning in august pride high above the
surrounding plain,&mdash;solitary convents, crested with
pinnacles and gables, in the verdant meadows on the margin of the
rolling stream, over which strongly fortified bridges with
massive portcullis and towers, afforded a defence from hostile
invaders.</p>
<p>This faint retrospect must kindle in the mind considerations
of the progress and fluctuations of science and taste,&mdash;the
character, condition, and habits of men in these
times,&mdash;with the works done &ldquo;in their days and in the
old time before them;&rdquo;&mdash;while the contemplation
thereof cannot fail of exciting gratitude to the <span
class="smcap">Supreme Giver</span>, for the security we
<i>now</i> enjoy, without the precaution of barbican and
battlements.</p>
<h2><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>PRESENT STATE.</h2>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A
lovely spot<br />
For all that life can ask!&nbsp; Salubrious! mild!<br />
Its hills are green; its woods and prospects fair;<br />
Its meadows fertile!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Cottle&rsquo;s

</blockquote>
<p>The hold situation of the town, girdled by the health-bearing
breezes of a beauteous river, with an eminence crown&rsquo;d by
aspiring temples,</p>
<blockquote><p>That upward cast their golden vanes, and shine<br
/>
A bright tiara,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>gives a striking and majestic appearance to Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>When seen from most parts of the adjacent country the town
forms a delightful object,&mdash;a gem encircled by a
paradise;&mdash;new beauties and charming views being continually
produced by the pre-eminent spires and towers; whilst the effect
in the background is much heightened by an extensive range of
noble mountains, which diversify the prospect, and add interest
to the rich and picturesque landscape.</p>
<p>The exterior of the town is in most parts separated from the
river by a portion of garden and meadow ground, skirted by a line
of genteel houses, which command delightful prospects of the
adjoining country.</p>
<p>As a place of residence Shrewsbury has long been considered
highly eligible, from its elevated and beautiful situation, the
salubrity and general healthfulness of its air, the natural
dryness of the soil, the agreeable drives and promenades by which
it is surrounded, and (what is equally important) the excellence
and purity of its water.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Many
parts of the environs have been justly recommended as suitable to
valetudinarians who may visit Shrewsbury from North Wales and
other parts, to avail themselves of the able medical assistance
which it possesses, and who are, as it were, enticed by the
agreeableness and variety of the scenery to a salutary and
necessary exercise.</p>
<p>The interior of the town presents several curious and
interesting specimens of the domestic architecture of our
ancestors; the projecting bay windows, fanciful antique carving,
mouldings, &amp;c. display a singular appearance in contrast with
the more modern habitations, in many of which the taste of their
respective proprietors is effectively evinced.</p>
<p>The streets, as in most other ancient towns, are irregularly
formed, and several of them, it must be admitted, are
inconveniently narrow.&nbsp; Many important alterations have
however been made, under the provisions of an act obtained in
1821, for removing obstructions, watching, lighting, and the
general improvement of the town, the powers of which are vested
in trustees, who must be persons occupying property rated at
&pound;50 per annum to the street assessment, or worth
&pound;2000 above reprizes and resident within the town, or
resident and receiving rents to the amount of &pound;80 per
annum, or non-resident and receiving rents from premises within
the town worth &pound;100 per annum, from whom a committee of
management of nine individuals is selected, three of whom retire
annually by rotation; and it has been remarked by one of the
first members of this committee, &ldquo;<i>that if judiciously
chosen and faithful to their trust</i>, <i>our town may in time
assume its due place among the cities of the
empire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1820 a company was established, with a capital of
&pound;8000, raised in 800 shares of &pound;10 each, to supply
the town with gas.</p>

<h2>ECCLESIASTICAL BUILDINGS.</h2>
<p>The public structures devoted to the service of Religion are
among the first objects that excite the attention, whilst by many
they are not unfrequently looked upon with peculiar feelings of
veneration and regard.</p>
<p>If the source of this feeling were traced, it would be found
connected with those principles and associations which every one
who acknowledges an all-bountiful Creator, or wishes well to his
country, would desire to cherish.</p>
<p>Shrewsbury, we learn, did not receive much improvement from
its original inhabitants, the Britons; yet what it lost in
nominal consequence as the metropolis of a kingdom it ultimately
gained in external splendour and real importance: this is
evinced, among other proofs, by the erection of five
ecclesiastical foundations, all of which were anterior to the
Norman conquest, and originated in Saxon piety.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Among
the earliest of these may be mentioned <span class="smcap">Saint
Chad&rsquo;s</span>, which is ascribed to one of the Mercian
kings, who is said to have converted the palace of the kings of
Powis into a church, about 780.</p>
<p>A dean and ten prebendaries or secular canons, with two vicars
choral, under the patronage of the Bishop of Lichfield, are
stated to have been placed here at a very remote period.</p>
<p>Under the Anglo-Saxon monarchs this college possessed twelve
hides of arable land, or as much as paid for 1440 acres to what
would be now called the land-tax; which, by proper cultivation,
appears from the Survey of Domesday to have increased more than
double.&nbsp; Other estates were subsequently added, which form
now only insulated districts of the parish.</p>
<p>By the act of 1 Edward VI. 1547, the College was dissolved,
the tythes and profits at that time being of the clear yearly
value of about &pound;50.&nbsp; The buildings and estates were
leased out, reserving only the small stipend of &pound;4. 6s. 8d.
for the parish minister, charged on the dean&rsquo;s prebendal
estate at Onslow.</p>
<p>Although a lease was granted of the tythes, yet only two years
afterwards the greater portion of them were appropriated by
Edward VI. in aid of the Free Grammar School.</p>
<p>In 1579 Queen Elizabeth granted the remaining possessions of
the deanery to Sir Christopher Hatton; but the corporation and
parish seem to have presented to the living from 1583 until
1658&ndash;9, from which time the patronage has rested with the
crown.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Saint Alkmund&rsquo;s Church</span> owes
its foundation to the piety of Ethelfleda, daughter of Alfred the
Great, soon after she succeeded to the sovereignty of the Mercian
territory in 912.</p>
<p>Her great nephew, King Edgar, being of the race of <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the
Northumbrian Prince Alkmund, increased the original endowment,
and (under the direction of Archbishop Dunstan) appointed a dean
and ten prebends.</p>
<p>In the reign of Edward the Confessor, this College possessed
eleven manors, nine of which, containing upwards of 4000 acres,
it retained at the Norman survey.</p>
<p>After experiencing many of the fluctuations common to
property, sacred or otherwise, during the dark ages and under
lawless government, these estates were at length alienated in
1147, at the particular request of the Dean, Richard de Belemis,
and with the consent of King Stephen and Pope Eugenius III. to
the monastery of Lilleshull, which the dean&rsquo;s brother,
Philip de Belemis, had just commenced, the Prebendaries however
taking care to reserve to themselves a life interest in their
several stipends.</p>
<p>The college being thus early dissolved and deprived of its
valuable estates, fell into a humble vicarage, which remained in
the patronage of the monks of Lilleshull until the dissolution,
when it lapsed to the crown, in whose hands it continued until
1628, when Rowland Heylin, Esq. <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a> of Pentreheylin,
Montgomeryshire, purchased the advowson for the &ldquo;feoffees
of St. Antholines,&rdquo; a society instituted for founding
lectureships and augmenting small livings in populous towns.</p>
<p>This society having been publicly denounced, and the orthodoxy
of its principles questioned, the ministers of King James, in
1663, directed its suppression, when the living again reverted to
the crown.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span><span
class="smcap">The Collegiate Church of St. Mary</span> is
considered to have been founded by King Edgar, about the year
980; although, from the extensive limits of the parish, it is
probable this was only the renovation of an older church
destroyed by the ravages of the Danes, who, in revenging the
slaughter of their predecessors, not only exercised their warfare
against mankind, but even those works of ingenuity and labour
which were consecrated to devotion did not escape their
desolating hand.</p>
<p>In the time of Edward the Confessor, this college possessed an
estate of nearly 1300 acres, &ldquo;for the maintenance of a
dean, seven prebendaries, and a parish priest,&rdquo; which
appears to have diminished in point of cultivation and consequent
value at the survey of Domesday, in which, however, the
&ldquo;vill of Chorleton,&rdquo; held in conjunction with the
church of St. Juliana, is unnoticed, having probably been
acquired afterwards.</p>
<p>At the suppression of colleges the revenue was &pound;42, when
Edward VI. appropriated the greater part of the tithes of this,
as he had done those of St. Chad&rsquo;s parish, to the bailiffs
and burgesses, for the foundation of a free school.</p>
<p>This church from very remote times has been a &ldquo;royal
free chapel,&rdquo; and thereby exempt from the jurisdiction of
the bishop.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church of St.
Juliana</span>.&mdash;Little is known of this, further than its
origin was Saxon, and that it held in the Norman survey
&ldquo;half a hide of land in the city.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon after
this period it became distinguished as a rectory and royal free
chapel, and was early united to the church of St. Michael within
the Castle, now destroyed. <a name="citation24"></a><a
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a></p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>In
1410, Henry IV. annexed both of these churches to his college at
Battlefield; and being thus deprived of its property, St.
Julian&rsquo;s became no better than a curacy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church of St. Peter</span>, called
&ldquo;<i>The Parish of the City</i>,&rdquo; was a small
structure of wood, built about Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s time,
by Siward, a Saxon nobleman, and stood on the site where Earl
Roger de Montgomery founded a large Benedictine Abbey in 1083,
which was re-dedicated to St. Peter, and endowed with a small
portion of the vast possessions granted by the Conqueror to the
first Earl of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>This venerable warrior being seized with illness while
residing in the castle he had lately built
here,&mdash;apprehensive, too, that his dissolution might not be
far distant,&mdash;and &ldquo;to be sure of
paradise,&rdquo;&mdash;determined, with the consent of his
countess Adelissa, to retire from the world, and become a monk
within the confines of his own monastery.</p>
<p>This resolution he acted upon July 14th, 1094: and dying three
days afterwards, obtained honourable interment in the &ldquo;Lady
Chapel&rdquo; of that pile he had zealously commenced, and,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By skill of earthly architect,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nearly completed, to the service and honour of his Maker.</p>
<p>Hugh, his second son, surnamed Probus for his courage, and
Goch (or the Red) by the Welshmen from his complexion, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>succeeded to
the earldom, and in filial affection came with his barons to the
abbey, to visit his father&rsquo;s tomb; when he confirmed all
former endowments, and gave many additional privileges, to which
several of his barons added estates. <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>Scarcely a century had elapsed from its foundation, before the
monastery possessed &ldquo;seventy-one distinct grants of manors
or lands, twenty-four churches, the tithes of thirty-seven
parishes or vills,&rdquo; besides many extensive immunities of
various descriptions, and an almost matchless collection of
unique relics, in addition to the remains of that popular
&ldquo;martyr,&rdquo; St. Wenefreda, which the monks procured,
after many tedious negociations, from the priests and inhabitants
of Gwytherin, in the county of Denbigh, in order to increase the
celebrity of their house.&nbsp; After their translation hither,
they were enshrined with much pomp near the high altar, and
attracted multitudes of pilgrims, whose benefactions greatly
contributed to the emolument of the church.</p>
<p>The abbot of this monastery had the honour of a seat in
Parliament, and the authority of a bishop within his house.&nbsp;
Of the 608 monasteries that existed in this kingdom at the time
of the dissolution, it is recorded &ldquo;the Abbey of Shrewsbury
was 34th in opulence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the valor of 26th Henry VIII. the annual income
was &pound;572. 15s. 5d. a revenue considered equal to about
&pound;4750 of modern currency.</p>
<p>The surrender of this abbey took place 24th January,
1539&ndash;40, when the estates and buildings immediately passed
into lay hands.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span><span
class="smcap">St. Giles&rsquo;s Church</span> was built early in
the reign of Henry I. for the service of a hospital of lepers,
which stood at the west end of the present edifice.</p>
<p>It is supposed to have become parochial about the middle of
the fifteenth century, on being united with the parish of Holy
Cross within the monastery, the abbot and convent, no doubt,
having previously possessed the patronage and appointment of
master.</p>
<p>Subsequent to these, were erected three large conventual
churches and eight smaller chapels, all of which shared the fate
of the dissolution; and of their remains the ceaseless operations
of time and the hand of man have spared but few traces.</p>
<p>Several chantries, altars, &amp;c. were also maintained by
private donations in these churches; and whether we consider the
munificence, the piety, or the superstition which raised them, we
must respect the fervency towards a good cause, and regret that
so much zeal was blessed with such little knowledge of the truths
which, under our reformed religion, we now so happily enjoy.</p>
<p>From this cursory view of the piety of our forefathers, it may
be justly asserted, that in the present day there is no
provincial town in the kingdom, considering its extent, where so
much has been done to promote the cause of religion, and to give
a suitable effect to buildings set apart for Divine Worship, as
in Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Those individuals, therefore, whose taste
and liberality have mainly contributed to the accomplishment of
this praiseworthy object, are deserving of the best thanks of
their cotemporaries; and to them posterity will owe a debt of
admiring gratitude, in those pleasing feelings of awe which
insensibly steal o&rsquo;er the mind while contemplating the
architectural beauties of <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>temples dedicated to <span
class="smcap">Him</span>, whose greatness as far exceeds the
capacity of human thought as doth the immensity of space the
smallest atom.</p>
<p>Our survey of these interesting buildings will commence, in
chronological arrangement, with</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In midst of towne fower Parish Churches

Full nere and close, together note that right:<br />
For they doe seeme a true love knot to sight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These quaint lines of our native poet Churchyard, with <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the
illustrative vignette, describe the situation which the spacious
cruciform church of Old Saint Chad occupied on the southern
eminence of the town.</p>
<p>The period of its early foundation has been already alluded
to, and the nearly total destruction of the fabric was occasioned
by workmen having very injudiciously commenced under-building
(contrary to the advice of an experienced architect,) one of the
pillars that supported the large central tower, which had shrunk
considerably from graves having been carelessly made too close to
its foundations.&nbsp; The slight vibration occasioned by the
chimes proclaiming their matin tune at four o&rsquo;clock, on
July 9th, 1788, caused the decayed pillar to give way, when the
ponderous tower rent asunder, and with the heavy peal of bells it
contained, falling on the roofs of the nave and transepts;
crushed those parts of the edifice into ruinous desolation,
producing a scene of horrid confusion more easily to be imagined
than described.&nbsp; The masons had a narrow but fortunate
escape, and were only waiting at the adjoining house of the
sexton for the keys of the church, to pursue their misdirected
scheme of economy.</p>
<p>The event excited a great consternation in the town, and the
exemplary vicar, the Rev. Thomas Stedman, addressed an
affectionate pastoral letter to his parishioners on the
improvement that should be made of so remarkable an interposition
of Providence, which occurred at a time when not a single person
was within the reach of any injury from it.</p>
<p>Before the church fell, apprehensions were entertained that
some fatal consequences might follow, from the appearances of
decay in different parts of the building; these fears, however,
were comparatively slight, and no immediate danger
expected.&nbsp; But after the event took place it was <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>found that
the shattered state of the edifice was such, that instead of
exciting surprise that it should fall when it did, there were
just grounds for amazement that it should have stood so
long.&nbsp; Had the decayed state of the building been thoroughly
understood before it gave way, the probable opinion would have
been, that whenever the disaster happened, it would be at a time
when the effects of it might have been dreadful to many;&mdash;as
when the greatest weight was in the galleries, or when the tower
had been shaken by the motion of the bells.&nbsp; Only a month
previous, 3000 persons, it is considered, were assembled in the
church to witness the interment of an officer under military
honours.</p>
<p>The old church was a majestic edifice, erected in the reign of
Henry III. in the style when the round Norman arches were giving
way to the beautiful lancet style.&nbsp; In 1393 the roofs and
tower, with the wooden spire covered with lead, were destroyed by
a calamitous fire, occasioned by the negligence of a plumber
while repairing the leads.&nbsp; The damage being considerable,
Richard II. granted to the inhabitants a remission of their
fee-farm rent, and certain other taxes, towards the
re-edification.</p>
<p>From the fragments of Saxon sculpture discovered in portions
of the walls after the fall of the late fabric, the edifice which
preceded it must have been considerably adorned.</p>
<p>The dawning light of the Reformation in Shrewsbury first
beamed in this church in 1407, by William Thorpe, a priest and
disciple of the doctrines promulgated by Wickliff.&nbsp; This
Salopian reformer, in a sermon before the bailiffs on the third
Sunday after Easter, boldly, preached against the prevailing and
favourite tenets of the Romish church; for his temerity he was
thrown into the prison of the town, by command of the local
authorities, where he remained about a month, and was afterwards
removed to Lambeth <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>for examination before the archbishop, the bailiffs
preferring the charge of heresy and schism against him.</p>
<p>The conduct of Thorpe before his spiritual superior was decent
and respectful, but at the same time he remained zealous in his
vindication of scripture, and firm in support of that which he
considered the truth,&mdash;thus intrepidly answering the
archbishop, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you at one word, I dare not
from the dread of God submit unto you, notwithstanding the tenure
and sentence that you have rehearsed to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
accordingly sent back to prison: his subsequent fate is nowhere
recorded, but it is conjectured on good grounds he was liberated
after the death of the archbishop, so that what Fox has asserted
of his having died a martyr to hard usage is probably
incorrect.</p>
<p>The exercise of the Protestant religion in this town also
began in this church in 1573, under the direction of the Bishop
of Lichfield and the Lord President of the Marches, as special
commissioners from Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The portion of the ruins now remaining stood south of the
choir, and formed a chantry chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary;
after the Reformation it was called the Bishop&rsquo;s Chancel,
from the circumstance of its being used at the visitations of the
bishop and archdeacon.&nbsp; The two wide semi-circular arches
(now walled up) separated it from the transepts and choir.&nbsp;
On the outside north wall are three stone stalls having pointed
arches, the concaves of which are groined; these originally
adjoined the high altar, and formed the seats of the priest,
deacon, and sub-deacon, during a part of the high mass.&nbsp; The
east and south sides display two mullioned windows; one adjoining
the newel staircase in the south-west pier, which once led to the
belfry is of an earlier design than the rest, and was probably
introduced when the building was repaired in 1496; the others
have elegant trefoiled tracery, and were erected in <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>1571, when
the chapel was nearly rebuilt by Humphrey Onslow, Esq. to the
dilapidations of which he appears to have been liable by the
lease granted to him of the deanery when the dissolution of the
college was anticipated in 1542&ndash;3.</p>
<p>The interior has an oak panelled ceiling, and contains a few
monumental tablets and hatchments, most of the ancient memorials
having been removed on the fall of the church to other
places.</p>
<p>This chapel is now used as a daily parochial school, and for
reading the burial service connected with the spacious cemetery
in which it stands.</p>
<p>Among the monuments is one to the memory of that excellent
man, the Rev. <span class="smcap">Job Orton</span>, V.D.M. who
&ldquo;being dead, yet speaketh,&rdquo; in the forcible
discourses and truly admirable writings he has left behind.&nbsp;
He was the friend and biographer of Doddridge, and died 16th
July, 1783, aged 66.&nbsp; His remains were interred at his
request in the grave of the Rev. J. Bryan, M.A. an ejected
minister from this church.</p>
<p>A humble gravestone near the railway leading towards Belmont
records the death of Capt. <span class="smcap">John
Benbow</span>, who was shot at the Castle, Oct. 16th, 1651, for
his attachment to the cause of King Charles the Second.</p>
<p>Several members of ancient families and distinguished
individuals connected with the town and county, received
interment in this church.&nbsp; Among these may be mentioned
those of <span class="smcap">Corbet</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mytton</span>, <span class="smcap">Burton</span>,
<span class="smcap">Owen</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lyster</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Ireland</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rowland Lee</span>, Bishop of Lichfield
and Coventry, and Lord President of the Marches, was buried
here.&nbsp; He died Jan. 27th, 1542&ndash;3, at the College, the
residence of his brother, Sir George Lee, who was the last dean
of the church.</p>
<h3><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>THE
NEW CHURCH OF SAINT CHAD</h3>
<p>is erected on a beautiful site near the Quarry, and,
considering the disadvantages of form which preclude the
possibility of much architectural effect, it may be looked upon
as an ornamental building.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p33b.jpg">
<img alt=
"New St. Chad&rsquo;s Church"
title=
"New St. Chad&rsquo;s Church"
 src="images/p33s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The church is formed by the intersection of two circles, with
a tower and portico attached; the smaller of the circles forming
the grand staircase, and the larger one the body, chancel, and
side staircases leading to the gallery.&nbsp; On each side of the
tower is a square wing 24 feet by 19, appropriated for a vestry
and robing room.</p>
<p>The exterior is divided into two stories, the lower one being
rusticated, and the upper springing from a moulding <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>displaying a
continued Ionic entablature, supported by coupled pilasters of
the same order; above the cornice is a well-proportioned
balustrade.</p>
<p>The windows are circular headed in the upper, and square in
the lower story, and, with the exception of that in the chancel,
are uniform; the latter is Venetian, the divisions being formed
with Corinthian pillars.</p>
<p>The portico consists of four Roman Doric columns and
entablature in full order, and is considered a very fine
specimen.</p>
<p>The steeple is divided into three parts, and, like the body of
the church, is rusticated at the base, which is square; on this
rests the second division, or bell chamber, octangular in shape,
and decorated with Ionic pilasters, cornice, &amp;c.; above rises
eight elegant Corinthian columns, surrounded with an iron
railing, and surmounted by a dome and cross.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The interior</span> carries with it an air
of importance, grandeur, and extent, derived mainly from that
form which in the exterior has so much shackled the efforts of
the architect: dazzled for a moment by the first impressions, the
detail is lost in the general effect; but from the whole the eye
is directed to those parts which constitute that whole, and here
defects may be discovered that will not stand the test of
architectural scrutiny.</p>
<p>The seats are well constructed, every individual being able to
see the officiating minister.&nbsp; The gallery is not thrown too
forward, but is in every respect in unison with the size of the
church; it is carried round the whole area with the exception of
the chancel, and is supported by a double row of ill-proportioned
Ionic columns, painted porphyry.&nbsp; A continued balustrade
finishes the front of the gallery, from which rises slender
fluted columns (surmounted <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>with entablature) for the support of
the roof, the frieze being decorated with cherubs.</p>
<p>The ceiling is enriched with a glory and cherubs in the
centre, surrounded by a wreath and other devices.</p>
<p>The chancel, contrary to general custom, is towards the north,
and is separated from the body of the church by a handsome arch
springing from an entablature supported by coupled composite
columns, elegantly proportioned, the capitals of which are richly
gilt.</p>
<p>The altar-piece is plain oak wainscot, with panels inscribed
according to the canon of the church, above which is a Venetian
window, containing a painting in enamelled glass of the
Resurrection of our Saviour, by the elder Eginton.&nbsp; This
window is shortly to be replaced by another, our townsman, Mr.
David Evans, having been directed by the munificence of the Rev.
Richard Scott, B.D. to exert his talents in the execution of a
splendid and faithful copy of the celebrated chef d&rsquo;ouvre
of Rubens, painted for the cathedral church of Antwerp, <span
class="smcap">the Descent from the Cross</span>, with the <span
class="smcap">Visitation</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Presentation in the Temple</span>.</p>
<p>The pulpit and reading desk stand in the centre of the area in
front of the chancel.</p>
<p>The organ is placed above the south or great entrance of the
church; it is in a mahogany case, with a small painting of David
playing upon the harp.&nbsp; The instrument was built by Gray, of
London, and cost 400 guineas.</p>
<p>Between the piers of the gallery-windows are hatchments; and
the building, although of modern date, contains several tasteful
memorials which indicate,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All that virtue, all that wealth e&rsquo;er
gave,<br />
Await alike the inevitable hour&mdash;<br />
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Among
these may be mentioned a large panelled tablet, having a bust of
the deceased by Chantrey, within a recess, commemorative of Mr.
John Simpson, &ldquo;who superintended the building of this
church; the bridges of Bewdley, Dunkeld, Craig, Ellachie, and
Bonar; the aqueducts of Pontcysyllte and Chirk; and the locks and
basins of the Caledonian Canal.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died 1815.</p>
<p>On each side of the entrance leading to the chancel are
tablets, highly enriched with sculpture, recording the decease of
the Rev. George Scott, of Betton Strange, in this parish, and of
Ann Lucretia, his wife; also of Richard Scott, of Peniarth Ucha,
Merionethshire, and Underdale, in the county of Salop.</p>
<p>On the east wall of the chancel is a small tablet in memory
of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">The Rev. <span
class="smcap">Thomas Stedman</span>, M.A.<br />
&ldquo;Forty-two years Vicar of this Parish, during which
period<br />
his mind, his writings, and his discourse<br />
were with deep humility devoted<br />
to the glory of God, the happiness of mankind,<br />
and the temporal and spiritual interests of his flock.&rdquo;<br
/>
He died Dec. 5th, 1825, in the 80th year of his age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a large Grecian tablet is a Latin inscription to the memory
of the late Rev. Francis Leighton, M.A. who died Sept. 7th, 1813,
aged 66 years. <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p>The body of the church is 100 feet in diameter, and the total
length, including the entrance and vestibule, 160 feet.&nbsp; The
building is of fine Grinshill stone, and was designed by Mr.
George Steuart, of London.&nbsp; It was commenced <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>March 2d,
1790, and consecrated August 20th, 1792, and will comfortably
accommodate a congregation of about 2300 persons.&nbsp; The total
cost, including site, organ, bells, &amp;c. was &pound;19,352, of
which &pound;15,800 was raised under act of parliament.</p>
<p>The steeple is 150 feet in height, and contains a full and
melodious peal of twelve bells; the weight of the tenor being 2
tons 1 cwt. and measures 16 ft. 6 in. in circumference at the
mouth.&nbsp; The balcony beneath the dome commands a fine
prospect of the town and immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>In the vestry is a carved statue of St. Chad in his episcopal
habit, holding a bible in his right hand and a crosier in his
left.&nbsp; It originally stood upon the organ in the old
church.</p>
<p>St. Chad&rsquo;s is considered the principal church of the
town; it is used on all public occasions, and is the place where
the archdeacon holds his visitations and probat court.</p>
<p>A lecture is delivered here every Thursday evening, according
to a bequest of the late James Phillips, Esq. of London, who by
his will (dated 1661) devises, after the death of his wife, the
rents of his property in Three Crown Court, Southward, unto the
mayor and aldermen of this town for that purpose, and also for a
lecture in the parish churches of Oswestry, Ellesmere, and
Whitchurch.&nbsp; This property now produces a good revenue.</p>
<p>On the east side of the church is a spacious cemetery.</p>
<p>The living is a vicarage in the gift of the crown, being
endowed in 1674, by the benefaction of Nathaniel Tench, Esq. with
&ldquo;the tithes of corn and hay of the grange of Crow
Meole,&rdquo; in commemoration of which the testator directed
that a sermon should be annually preached on the 6th of June.</p>
<p>The parish comprises nearly one-half of the town, and <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>extends
several miles into the country, having two chapels of
ease,&mdash;St. George&rsquo;s (Frankwell), and Bicton, three
miles distant.</p>
<h3>ST. MARY&rsquo;S CHURCH</h3>
<p>stands on a commanding situation, nearly one hundred feet
above the level of the river, on the north-eastern side of the
town, and is one of the most interesting ecclesiastical edifices
in the county, displaying in its construction almost every
variety of ancient architecture, and affording to the <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>antiquary and
man of taste a rich and unique field for observation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>It is a cruciform building, consisting of a nave, side aisles,
transepts, spacious chancel, two chantry chapels, and a lofty
spire steeple.</p>
<p>In common with our early churches we have no opportunity of
ascertaining the precise date of its erection on written
testimony.&nbsp; The probable period of foundation has been
stated, page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page24">24</a></span>; the renovation and subsequent
addition is therefore presumptive, and our decision must be
governed by analogy of style with other edifices, whose origin is
authenticated.</p>
<p>That the era of ancient buildings may be inferred from the
internal evidence they themselves afford of their respective
antiquity admits of little doubt; indeed, the amiable poet, Gray,
who had much knowledge in antiquarian pursuits, has said that
&ldquo;they constantly furnish, to the well informed eye, arms,
ornaments, and other indubitable marks by which their several
ages may be ascertained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There will be little difficulty in appropriating the ancient
portions of this building to distinct ages, if we except the task
of assigning a correct criteria to the curious mixture displayed
in the columns which support the semi-circular arches of the
nave, where the Norman and pointed styles are singularly blended
together, the union of which will afford matter of interesting
speculation to the experienced antiquary.</p>
<p>William of Malmesbury has related an anecdote of the pious
Wolstan, Bishop of Worcester (from 1062 to 1095) praying, on his
way to Chester, in the <i>wooden church of St. Peter</i>, in this
town, <a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a> and of the &ldquo;citizens <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>asking him
why he preferred it to the church which they called St.
Mary&rsquo;s;&rdquo;&mdash;a question we may reasonably conclude
as shewing this was then, in their opinion, from some
circumstance, a church of no little consequence.</p>
<p>The superior taste and enlarged views of improvement
manifested by the Normans in the arts, caused the restoration of
many important churches in much less time than a century after
they had obtained the conquest of our island.</p>
<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s, no doubt, from its antiquity, required
restoration, and excited their early attention; but although
destitute of positive data, as before stated, from whence to
ascribe a period to its re-edification, the various improvements
plainly evident in several parts of the fabric will easily be
discovered by the critical eye of the architectural
antiquary.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that three distinct styles are
apparent,&mdash;the Anglo-Norman of the 12th century, in the
basement of the tower, nave, transepts, and doorways; the early
lancet style in the windows of the transepts and chancel; the
pointed and obtuse arch of the 15th and 16th century in the side
aisles, clere-story, chantry, chapels, &amp;c.</p>
<p>These shall be carefully examined by analysis, and the
predominant features appropriated with caution to their
respective periods.</p>
<p>The greater part of a new structure, it is therefore
conjectured, was raised on the site of a previous Saxon building,
probably early in the reign of Henry I.&nbsp; This is evident
from the plain circular windows inserted in the massive basement
of the tower, which, like the lower portion of the entire
building, is of red stone, and flanked by broad flat buttresses,
similar to those on the lower part of the Abbey tower.</p>
<p>The tower of St. Mary&rsquo;s originally was probably not
higher than the part composed of red stone, and was <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>terminated
like the generality of Norman towers, by a plain parapet.</p>
<p>The struggle between the Norman and pointed styles sometimes
occasioned incongruous arches, and we may attribute the rude
pointed doorway of the tower having an internal arch nearly
triangular, to the reign of Stephen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The South Porch</span> of the nave is of
the early Norman era, the outward arch circular, having zigzag
mouldings issuing from clustered columns, and an inner rib,
obtusely pointed; the windows on each side are curious as early
specimens of the rudiments of the mullioned window, introduced
about the time of Stephen; the arches of these windows rest on
short thick columns, and are bisected into two lights by a
similar pillar as a mullion, the capitals of which are all
different; in the apex is a quatrefoil, one of the simplest and
most ancient kind of ornaments.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the porch is also an example of the most
ancient kind of groined vault, having neither boss nor ornament;
above this is a chamber (entered from the church by a newel
staircase), and lighted by a pointed window.</p>
<p>The inner doorway of the porch is an enriched round arch, with
chevron, lozenge, and foliated mouldings.&nbsp; That on the north
side of the nave is similar in style; and the doorways (now
closed) in the north and south transepts are very elegant
specimens of the style which prevailed from the Conquest to the
time of Henry I.; the latter is decorated with alternate lozenge
panels filled with an embossed flower.</p>
<p>A progressive movement of refinement and beauty took place in
the science of architecture during the reign of Henry III. when
the heavy Norman was succeeded by the slender lancet arch and its
attendant ornaments.&nbsp; The <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>transepts of this church are fine
specimens of this transition of the styles, the north and south
ends of which are terminated by beautifully proportioned triple
lancet windows enriched with slender shafts and mouldings.</p>
<p>About the close of the 15th century, a greater stateliness of
character and ornamental arrangement became the prevailing
characteristic of architectural display, and the general features
of the building were altered to the fashionable style.</p>
<p>The walls of the side aisles previous to this time were much
lower, which is indicated by a slope in the stone work at the
west end and a pier at the south-west, on which the roof
originally rested.&nbsp; When the walls were raised, three
mullioned windows were substituted on each side for round-headed
lights, which narrowed towards the exterior surface of the wall,
similar, no doubt, to that still remaining at the west end.</p>
<p>The nave shortly afterwards received the addition of a
clere-story, lighted by a range of short windows with obtusely
pointed arches, extending the whole length of the nave and
chancel.</p>
<p>To render these important alterations of the fabric complete,
the low massy tower was raised, and large double pointed windows
were placed on each side, and the whole surmounted with an
embattled parapet and pinnacles, which (being much decayed) were
judiciously restored in 1816.&nbsp; From this tower rises an
octagonal spire of noble proportions, which may be ranked as
equal in height to the <i>third loftiest spire</i> in the
kingdom, and forms an interesting and prominent object from every
part of the rich and beautiful scenery which surrounds the
town.</p>
<p>The dimensions, as taken at the last repair in 1818,
are&mdash;tower, 78 feet 4 inches; spire, to the top of vane, 141
feet 10 inches; total height, 220 feet 2 inches.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>The
chapel south of the chancel has a remarkably lofty roof, and on
the south side four handsome pointed windows of Henry the
Sixth&rsquo;s time; each window is divided by a buttress, on
which rests a crocketed pinnacle.&nbsp; The eastern end of this
building was originally finished by a large window, but within
its space two lofty round-headed lights, with singular canopies
in the debased style, prevalent about the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, have been inserted.</p>
<p>The chancel is terminated by a large window, divided by
mullions into two tiers of eight lights each, the apex being
ramified into inelegant tracery, introduced in repairing the
damage which this window (and that alluded to in the above
chapel) sustained during an extreme tempest in 1579.</p>
<h4>THE INTERIOR</h4>
<p>of this church is strikingly noble, and calculated to inspire
the mind with awe; but although the purer light of later times
has in some degree eclipsed the adventitious aid intended to be
conveyed to the feelings, during the religious ceremonies of our
forefathers, by the almost mysterious effect produced from
intermingled arches and clustered columns, canopied niches,
costly shrines, and the mellow reflection of the storied pane
shedding</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The dim blaze of radiance richly
clear,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in these august edifices of former ages, they still possess a
power over the imagination, and insensible must that mind be
which is not susceptible of appropriate religious
influences,&mdash;subdued thoughts,&mdash;and, inspiring
conceptions of divine majesty, when beholding the &ldquo;long
drawn aisle&rdquo; and &ldquo;high embower&rsquo;d roof,&rdquo;
where all forms and differences of opinion, it has been justly
remarked, become &ldquo;trivial for awhile, amidst the sublimity
of temples so well suited to the adoration of
omnipotence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nave is separated from the side aisles by <i>four </i><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span><i>semicircular arches</i>, <i>resting on elegant
clustered columns</i>, with capitals decorated with foliage of
different devices, from the rudest to the richest design.&nbsp;
The mouldings of these arches have bolder projections, but are
less massive than those of the early Norman, and more delicately
finished, and although the mouldings on the shafts are peculiar
to the earliest pointed style, they happily harmonize with the
circular arches.</p>
<p>At the eastern extremity of each side aisle, opening to the
transepts, is a semi-circular arch, resting on thick round
pillars, with a regular base and indented capital, ornamented
with sculpture of the earliest Norman era; similar arches lead to
the chantry chapels.&nbsp; These arches, from their general
style, are evidently the oldest part of the fabric, and we may
venture to ascribe them to a period not later than the
Conquest.&nbsp; In removing the accumulations of colouring and
plaister from the walls and arches of this part, in 1828, the
<i>distinguishing marks</i> of the <i>operative masons</i>
employed in working the stones were discovered, and still are to
be seen, being the same as those now used. <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a></p>
<p>The choir and transepts are divided by three most beautiful
pointed arches, rising from piers similar to those described in
the nave.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the nave is of oak, the intersections of the
beams being formed into panels richly decorated with ornamented
quatrefoils and foliage, carved bosses, flowers, grotesque
figures, &amp;c.&nbsp; A beautiful cornice of vine branches,
grapes interspersed with masks, are placed round the walls
beneath the roof.&nbsp; The whole is in excellent <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>preservation,
and supposed to be one of the finest specimens of the ancient
fretted ceiling in the kingdom.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Chancel</span> is elevated above the
church by a double ascent, and the ceiling, like that of both the
transepts, is excellently painted, but panelled in a style
somewhat similar to that of the nave, and adorned with some of
the rich fret work removed from the wreck of the churches of St.
Chad and St. Alkmond.</p>
<p>On the north side of the altar is a most beautiful triple
lancet window, with arches remarkably acute, and resting on
isolated columns, whose capitals are adorned with elegant
foliage, &amp;c.&nbsp; The window is filled with three figures in
ancient stained glass.</p>
<p>Whilst these pages are passing through the press, a most
important improvement has been effected in the chancel, by
removing the altar screen, which, although a handsome Grecian
design, obstructed not only much of the eastern window, but was
quite out of character with the building.&nbsp; Another of a more
appropriate description will be substituted.</p>
<p>The eastern window contains the truly splendid glass that
adorned the chancel of old St. Chad&rsquo;s, and which escaped
the destruction that befel the other parts of the fabric.&nbsp;
It was carefully removed and presented to this parish by the
trustees for putting into execution the act for rebuilding the
new church.</p>
<p>This glass, unequalled in point of beauty and colouring,
represents <span class="smcap">The Genealogy of Christ</span>,
from the root of Jesse.&nbsp; The patriarch occupies the breadth
of three bays of the window, being depicted as reclining in a
deep sleep, with his head resting upon an embroidered pillow, and
supported on his right hand.&nbsp; From his loins issues a <span
class="smcap">Vine</span>, the branches of which, before its
disarrangement, overspread the whole window, inclosing within the
ovals <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

class="smcap">King</span> or <span class="smcap">Prophet</span>
of the ancestry of Joseph, the series of which is finished by the
husband of the Virgin Mary in a devotional posture at the feet of
his progenitor.</p>
<p>Many of the figures are depicted with their peculiar
emblems.&nbsp; The ground of the whole is varied and exquisitely
vivid, on which the clusters of grapes and the bright verdure of
the vine leaves are displayed with great effect.</p>
<p>Two compartments contain figures of ancient knights vested in
the hawberk and bearing their square banners, and kneeling
beneath foliated tabernacles.&nbsp; They represent Sir John
Cherleton, Lord of Powis, and his son Sir Owen.&nbsp; From the
following translation of an inscription on a part of the
window,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Pray for
Monsieur John de Charlton, who caused this glazing to be made,
and for Dame Hawis his companion,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the date of its erection is ascertained to be about the middle
of the fourteenth century; it was originally placed in the church
of the convent of Grey Friars in this town, from whence it was
removed to St. Chad&rsquo;s at the Dissolution.</p>
<p>Many of the figures have been displaced in their change of
situation; their re-arrangement, however, is now in progress, and
to complete the genealogical line additional figures will be
added, and the lower tier of arches in the window, formerly
filled with brick-work, have been opened to their base.</p>
<p>At the west end of the nave is a peculiarly rich and
full-toned organ, made by the celebrated builders Harris and
Byfield, in 1729, which has recently been improved by the
addition of an octave and a half of pedal pipes.</p>
<p>This instrument stands upon a handsome stone screen, divided
into three compartments, formed by as many obtusely pointed
arches, and divided by buttresses of two <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>stories,
highly decorated with reticulated divisions, containing an open
flower in relief; around the inner recesses of the arches are the
following inscriptions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Venite Domino exultemus<br />
Rupi salutis jutilemus<br />
Jehovam hymnis concinamus<br />
Et grates illi persolnamus&mdash;Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Jehovam virgints laudate<br />
Senes et pueri celebrate<br />
Psalmis ecclesia sanctorum<br />
Extollat Dominum Dominorum.</p>
<p>Laudate carminis clamore<br />
Laudate buccinae clangore<br />
Laudate organo sonoro<br />
Laudate cymbalis et choro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Above is a series of smaller arches similar in style, having
cinque-foil heads, and filled with the like reticulated divisions
and ornament, each of the arches being divided by a small plain
buttress; the string course is charged with elaborately carved
heads of angels, pateras, &amp;c. and the spandrils of the
several arches throughout are enriched with elegant and varied
foliage, exquisitely sculptured.&nbsp; The whole forming a most
prominent and imposing feature to the main entrance of the nave,
and will be a permanent monument of the good taste and
munificence of the donor, the Rev. W. G. Rowland, M.A.</p>
<p>The screen was designed by and executed under the
superintendence of Mr. John Carline, of this town, and is a work
creditable to his professional abilities.</p>
<h4>THE NORTH TRANSEPT</h4>
<p>has a rich and pleasing appearance on entering the church <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>from the
eastern door, <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a> through a porch which was once a
chantry chapel, and connected with the transept by a fine Norman
arch.</p>
<p>The triple windows of this and the corresponding transept are
filled with small full-length figures in stained glass, bearing
their respective insignia, and judiciously placed within ovals of
chaste mosaic patterns.&nbsp; The centre of the middle light has
the arms of King George the Third, with the following
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>Above these arms is the figure of the Virgin Mary, and below
is St. Andrew.&nbsp; The dexter lancet window is occupied with
the figures of St. Philip, St. Bartholomew, and St. James the son
of Zebedee, and the sinister with St. Simon, St. Thomas, and St.
Matthias.&nbsp; At the bottom is the following
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Ioannes Brickdale

<h4>MONUMENT<br />
TO THE LATE REV. J. B. BLAKEWAY;</h4>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>which for elegance of design, beauty of execution, and <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>general
effect, has perhaps rarely been surpassed in modern times.</p>
<p>This beautiful Memorial was designed by Mr. John Carline, of
this town, and is upwards of 12 feet in length and 16 feet in
height, and is divided into three compartments by clustered
buttresses, which sustain richly crocketed pinnacles.&nbsp; The
centre compartment comprises a large pointed arch, cusped,
canopied, and crocketed, the back of which is deeply recessed,
and contains the following inscription in ornamental Roman
capitals:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To the Memory of the
Reverend<br />
JOHN BRICKDALE BLAKEWAY, M.A.&nbsp; F.A.S.<br />
Thirty-one years Ordinary and Official<br />
And Thirty-two years Minister of this Parish,<br />
This Monument is erected<br />
By the Voluntary Subscription of his Parishioners,<br />
As a tribute of respect for his talents,<br />
Esteem for his virtues,<br />
And gratitude for his long and faithful services<br />
As their Friend and Pastor.<br />
He died the tenth day of March, <span
class="GutSmall">MDCCCXXVI</span>.<br />
Aged sixty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On each side of the above compartment is an elegant niche with
a cinquefoil head, octagonal back, and groined ceiling.&nbsp;
These niches are surmounted by acute-angled crocketed canopies
formed of deep mouldings; and resting on the head of each niche
within the canopy is a cinquefoil within a circle.&nbsp; In a
similar situation in the centre compartment is a shield
containing the following arms:&mdash;Argent, on a bend engrailed
sable, three bezants; impaling argent, a fess vaire between three
unicorns passant, gules.</p>
<p>The above divisions rest on an altar tomb, the front of which
is divided into twelve small niches with trefoil heads.&nbsp; <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>These niches
are separated by small buttresses, with crocketed canopies and
pinnacles.</p>
<p>Mr. Blakeway was the son of Joshua Blakeway, Esq. of this
town, and a gentleman whose pleasing adaptation of manners and
amiable walk through life gained him the universal respect of his
fellow townsmen.&nbsp; Neither the church nor the state had a
more faithful defender of its rights or supporter of its dignity,
nor the true interests of his native town a more watchful
guardian.</p>
<p>As a scholar and a gentleman, united with the character of a
true christian, we shall perhaps &ldquo;ne&rsquo;er look upon his
like again.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a preacher he was admired for his
forcible illustration of holy writ, and the valuable admonitions
clothed in the language of affection which his discourses
generally contained, whilst his devoutness in the performance of
the sacred duties of the sanctuary must have impressed their
importance on all who heard them.&nbsp; In his personal
appearance he was tall and robust;&mdash;his face bore the line
of thought, and his ample forehead bespoke the mind that dwelt
within.&nbsp; As an author he had written much and published
little, and was known only to the literary world previous to 1821
by a few sermons, controversial tracts, and critical notes in
Malone&rsquo;s edition of Boswell&rsquo;s Life of Johnson.&nbsp;
His name, however, will be immortalized in the valuable History
of Shrewsbury which he commenced in 1820, with the Venerable
Archdeacon Owen, and just lived to see the general history and
ecclesiastical portions published in two quarto volumes, which
elaborate undertaking will obtain for him and his revered friend
and colleague the respect and gratitude of every true Salopian in
subsequent generations.</p>
<p>Mr. Blakeway likewise shewed much attention and devotedness to
the antiquities of his native county, and the <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>valuable mass
of manuscripts he left behind in illustration of its genealogical
and topographical history will remain also as a monument of his
industry. <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a></p>
<p>His last end was peace,&mdash;for he departed almost without a
sigh, and nearly without losing that benignant smile which was so
peculiar to him.&nbsp; His remains were interred on the right of
the west entrance to the church-yard.</p>
<p>Three beautiful specimens of monumental sculpture, designed by
the same architect, occupy the north wall, and harmonize with the
splendid memorial just described, a detail of which would occupy
too much space.&nbsp; The lancet window in the west wall contains
a fine ancient figure in stained glass of St. John the
Evangelist, arrayed in a robe which displays a most splendid
specimen of the ancient ruby glass of the old masters; the hem of
the garment is brilliantly studded with pearls.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Ancient Font</span> stands in the
centre of the area, and is very handsome.&nbsp; The basin is
octangular, each side having an ornamented quatrefoil, in the
centre of which is a large double rose.&nbsp; The angles have
been adorned with busts of angels bearing shields, and the
pedestal is pierced into gothic arches, divided by small shelving
buttresses.</p>
<p>In the north-eastern angle is an octangular turret, in which a
small doorway opens to a staircase leading to a chamber which was
no doubt once a chantry.&nbsp; It is lighted by a curious
triangular window, with a trefoil on the intrado <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of each arch,
the mouldings of which are deeply recessed.&nbsp; Below this is
another chantry chapel, now used as a <span
class="smcap">Vestry</span>, having at the east end an early
Norman light, and on the north a mullioned window of the
fifteenth century.&nbsp; Under a low pointed arch beneath this
window is a monumental tomb composed of alabaster, but sunk into
the floor for economy of space: it bears the figures of a warrior
and his lady in the act of devotion, supposed to represent
Nicholas Stafford and his wife Katherine.&nbsp; The former was
bailiff of the town in 1458, and died in 1471.</p>
<h4>SOUTH TRANSEPT.</h4>
<p>The window of this transept contains the figures of our
Saviour, St. James the son of Alpheus, and St. Thaddeus; in the
dexter compartments are those of St. Matthew the Evangelist, St.
Paul, and St. Mark; and in the sinister those of St. John the
Evangelist, St. Peter, and St. Luke.&nbsp; Underneath this window
is &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Gulielmus Gorsuch Rowland</span>
A.M. <span class="smcap">hujus ecclesl&aelig; judex officialis et
minister hanc fenestram faciendam curavit anno</span>
1829.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The windows of this and the north transept were executed by
Mr. D. Evans, of Shrewsbury, and may be considered as some of the
finest specimens of the art in the kingdom, both as regards
brilliancy and harmony of colours, beauty of design, and
exquisite workmanship, whilst the &ldquo;dim religious
light&rdquo; which they shed around, imparts an impressiveness of
character that at once bespeaks the sacred purpose of the place
as the House of Prayer.</p>
<p>Below the south window of this transept is a bold composition
of monumental architecture, designed by Mr. J. Carline,
consisting of three acute-angled crocketed canopies, crowned with
a finial.&nbsp; The labels of the arches are enriched with
foliage, and the interior sweep fashioned <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>in the ogee
manner.&nbsp; From the lateral piers, and between each division
of the arches, springs an elegant crocketed pinnacle panelled and
finished by an open flower.</p>
<p>It is much to be wished that the correct taste displayed in
these and other beautiful specimens of the decorated style of
monumental architecture, recently erected in this church, was
more generally manifested in the adaptation of monuments to the
character of the buildings in which they are to be placed,
instead of the unsightly tablets so commonly introduced, and
which frequently contribute anything but ornament to our ancient
churches.</p>
<p>From the south transept a fine Norman arch opens to the</p>
<h4>TRINITY CHAPEL,</h4>
<p>which also has a communication with the chancel by an arch in
the pointed style.</p>
<p>This building (57 feet by 30) was at first of smaller
dimensions, as is evident from two lancet windows (beneath which
are two very early loop holes) in the wall next to the south
aisle.&nbsp; Immediately above the shelving portion still visible
of the roof of the original chapel is a peculiar circular
window.</p>
<p>The enlargement was effected by the Draper&rsquo;s Company
soon after their incorporation in 1461, having therein a guild or
fraternity to the Holy Trinity.&nbsp; Within the south wall is
the sedilia formerly used by the officiating priests, and the
remains of a piscina, all of which were once overspread with
elegant canopies.</p>
<p>On the opposite side is a large pointed arch, now walled
up.&nbsp; Under this is an altar tomb, the sides of which are
divided by small buttresses in ornamental niches of the early
decorated style.&nbsp; Above is a mutilated recumbent figure of a
cross-legged knight in linked armour, supposed <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>to represent
one of the <span class="smcap">Leyburnes Lords of Berwick</span>,
in this parish, and who died about the middle of the 14th
century.&nbsp; The grave below was opened in 1816, and was
composed of wrought masonry, when, after a little loose rubbish
had been removed, some leg and thigh bones were discovered.&nbsp;
On digging about three feet lower to the bottom of the tomb, a
skeleton was found wrapped in leather, but without a head.&nbsp;
This is conjectured to be the skeleton of Thomas Percy, Earl of
Worcester, who was beheaded after the battle of Shrewsbury, and
his head sent to London, while his body found an asylum in the
tomb of a family which had become extinct.</p>
<p>This church, in 1232, was the scene of an assemblage of
legates, convened by command of the Pope to hear charges which
had been preferred against Llewelyn for repeated infractions of
treaties.&nbsp; This negociation was at length left to six
referees on the part of King Henry III. and four on that of the
Welsh Prince, by which peace was maintained for a season.</p>
<p>When Charles the First visited this town in 1642, it is
recorded he took &ldquo;a protestation and the sacrament upon it
to defend the Protestant religion established by Queen Elizabeth
and his royal father,&rdquo; which solemn scene, it is supposed,
took place within this edifice, being the parish church of the
mansion in which he was sojourning.&nbsp; King James the Second,
it is also said, attended divine service here in 1687, after
which he exercised the royal gift of healing by touching many
persons for the king&rsquo;s evil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Monuments</span> of particular
interest having been already noticed in their proper situations,
it need only be remarked that there are mural tablets
commemorative of individuals connected with the families of <span
class="smcap">Lyster</span>, <span class="smcap">Lloyd</span> (of
R&ucirc;g, &amp;c.), <span class="smcap">Morhall</span>, <span
class="smcap">Blakeway</span>, &amp;c. on the walls of the
chancel, and several other memorials in the nave, <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>transepts,
and chapel; which the extended description of this church, and
the confined limits of the present work, will not permit further
to enumerate.</p>
<p>The length of the building from east to west is 160 feet,
breadth (including side aisles) 50 feet.</p>
<p>The tower contains a peal of ten bells, the harmony of which,
it is considered, cannot be excelled by that of any peal in the
kingdom: weight of tenor 21 cwt. 2 qrs. 17 lbs.</p>
<p>On the west wall of the steeple is an inscription to the
memory of Thomas Cadman, who lost his life in a bold attempt to
descend from the top of the spire by means of a rope, which he
had fixed to it and brought down to the Gay meadow, on the other
side of the river Severn.&nbsp; He fell near the Water-lane gate,
Feb. 2, 1739, aged 28, at a time when &ldquo;the ground was iron
and the Severn glass,&rdquo; owing, as the epitaph records,
to</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;A faulty cord
being drawn too tight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parish of Saint Mary extends several miles in detached
parts of the country, having within its boundaries five chapels
of ease, viz. Albrighton, Astley, Berwick, Clive, and St.
Michael&rsquo;s (Castle-foregate).</p>
<p>The church is a royal peculiar, and the official court has
probate of all wills and cognizance of all other ecclesiastical
matters arising within the parish.&nbsp; The living is a
perpetual curacy, and was, previous to the late municipal act, in
the presentation of the Corporation of Shrewsbury; and in the
choice of a minister, the son of a burgess, who has been educated
at the royal free grammar school, or (in case there be no
burgess&rsquo;s son of that description) one born in the parish
of Chirbury, with a qualification similar to the foregoing, is to
have the preference.</p>
<h3><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>SAINT
ALKMUND&rsquo;S CHURCH</h3>
<p>is situate at a short distance from St. Mary&rsquo;s, and its
cemetery adjoins that of St. Julian&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The fine old cruciform church of this parish was
inconsiderately destroyed in 1794, under a mistaken apprehension
of its stability.&nbsp; The present building, with the exception
of the tower and spire, which fortunately escaped the fate of the
old church, was opened for divine service Nov. 8, 1795, at a cost
of rather more than &pound;3000.</p>
<p>The new structure is of Grinshill stone, and in the style
called modern gothic, having six lofty pointed windows on each
side, filled with slender mullions of cast-iron; between the
windows are graduated buttresses.</p>
<p>The interior is handsomely fitted up, and the general effect
pleasing, although not in strict conformity with a gothic
building,&mdash;wanting that sombre grandeur characteristic of
this style of architecture.&nbsp; It is 82 feet long by 44 feet
wide, with a small chancel terminated by a pointed window filled
with enamelled glass emblematical of &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Evangelical Faith</span>,&rdquo; depicted in the
character of a female figure in the attitude of kneeling upon a
cross, with her arms extended, and eyes elevated towards a
celestial crown which appears in the opening clouds.&nbsp; The
countenance has an interesting expression of adoration, and the
motto, &ldquo;Be thou faithful unto death,&rdquo; &amp;c. is
inscribed on an open volume.&nbsp; The window was painted by the
elder Egginton, and cost 200 guineas.</p>
<p>At the west end is a capacious gallery, containing a small
fine-toned organ by Gray, of London, erected by a subscription in
1823.</p>
<p>The principal entrance to the church is in the base of the
tower, under an elegant pointed arch recessed within a square
aperture, on either side of which are niches, most <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>barbarously
repaired in 1825; above is a bold mullioned window in the style
of the sixteenth century, when the tower and spire were probably
built.&nbsp; In this window are two ancient escutcheons in
stained glass, displaying England and France quarterly, and the
arms of Richard Sampson, Bishop of Lichfield, and Lord President
of the Marches from 1543 to 1548.</p>
<p>The tower is finely proportioned, being flanked with double
buttresses gradually diminishing, and terminated with a crocketed
pinnacle; an open parapet of pointed arches surrounds the base of
the spire, which, though not remarkable for height, is considered
by persons of good taste &ldquo;to possess singular elegance of
form.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tower contains eight musical bells, recast
in 1813, and is 70 feet high, the spire 114, making a total of
184 feet from the ground.</p>
<p>In a vault beneath this church are interred the remains of
Thomas Jones, Esq. who died in 1642.&nbsp; He was six times
bailiff, and the <span class="smcap">first Mayor of
Shrewsbury</span>; also those of Sir Thomas Jones, Lord Chief
Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who died 1692, to whom and
other members of this ancient Shropshire family are several
memorials.&nbsp; Other monumental tablets also relieve the walls
of the building.</p>
<p>The old structure contained many curious brasses and
monuments; the former were sold, and the latter dispersed, on its
unnecessary demolition.</p>
<p>The living is a vicarage in the gift of the Crown, and a
weekly lecture is preached in the church on Wednesdays.</p>
<h3><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>SAINT
JULIAN&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>

 src="images/p59s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Juliana, occupies an elevated
situation at the top of Wyle Cop, and was erected 1749&ndash;50,
from a design by Mr. T. F. Prichard, of this town, on the site of
an Anglo-Norman structure, which had become ruinous.</p>
<p>It is a plain oblong building of brick, and stone dressings,
83 feet by 48, with a small recess for the chancel.</p>
<p>At the west end is the tower of the old church; the <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>basement is
of red stone, and of a date far anterior to the superstructure,
which is of the 16th century, and crowned by a handsome embattled
parapet and eight lofty pinnacles, restored in 1818, when the
masonry of the tower was chipped and repaired.&nbsp; The tower
contains a peal of six bells, recast in 1706, and an excellent
clock, the dial of which is illuminated at night.</p>
<p>In the south wall of the chancel is an ancient figure,
probably intended to represent St. Juliana.</p>
<p>The interior is particularly neat, possessing an air of
solemnity unusual in the generality of modern churches.&nbsp;
Four large Roman-Doric pillars support the roof of the nave,
which is coved and adorned with the fret-work of the old
church.&nbsp; Galleries occupy three sides of the building.&nbsp;
At the west end is an excellent organ, by Bowsher and Fleetwood,
of Liverpool, erected by a subscription in 1834, the exterior of
which is tasteful in design, and harmonizes with the internal
architecture of the edifice.</p>
<p>The pulpit is handsome, and belonged to the old church.&nbsp;
The altar-piece and furniture of the chancel are in good taste;
the former is of wainscot, and presents a Roman Doric basement,
supporting Ionic pilasters and entablature with modillion
cornice, from which springs a rich architrave surrounding a
Venetian window, in the centre light of which is a figure in
stained glass of <span class="smcap">St. James bearing the Holy
Scriptures</span>.&nbsp; The side lights contain the royal arms,
and those of the see of Lichfield, impaling Cornwallis.</p>
<p>In the windows of the south gallery are the armorial bearings
of Queen Elizabeth, the family of Bowdler, a fine ancient shield
of the town arms, and heads of St. Peter and St. Paul, surmounted
by their emblems, the keys and sword.&nbsp; On the north side are
the arms of Prince, Bennett, Astley, the Earl of Tankerville, and
a figure of St. John.</p>
<p>In the floor of the south aisle is an ancient gravestone, <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>preserved
from the former church: round the edge is a Longobardic
inscription to the memory of Edmund Tromwyn, who is supposed to
have died about the close of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>There are several mural monuments in the aisles and chancel:
on the north side of the latter is a pedimented tablet set on a
square table of dove-coloured marble, with the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Sacred to the Memory<br
/>

</blockquote>
<p>In the south aisle, a plain tablet surmounted by a lion
commemorates the public spirit and unremitting exertions of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Robert Lawrence</span>, &ldquo;in opening the
great road through Wales between the united kingdoms, and for
establishing <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Sept. 3d, 1806, aged 57 years.</p>
<p>The living is a perpetual curacy in the presentation of the
Right Hon. the Earl of Tankerville, and the parish comprehends
the Wyle Cop and the suburb of Coleham, but isolated districts of
it are intermixed with several of the other parishes at different
ends of the town.</p>
<p>A Sunday evening lecture was commenced at this church, April
20th, 1828, for the &ldquo;free accommodation of the town at
large,&rdquo; the parishioners having consented to lend their
pews for the occasion.&nbsp; Several of the clergy connected with
the town preach alternately at this additional service.</p>
<h3><span class="GutSmall">THE PARISH OF</span><br />
ST. MICHAEL WITHIN THE CASTLE.</h3>
<p>It has been already stated (page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page24">24</a></span>) that the royal free chapel of St.
Juliana became at an early period appurtenant to the church of
St. Michael, the situation of which it has been shown was within
the castle.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether a church existed here anterior to the
Norman conquest; however, in the survey called Domesday-book,
compiled in 1085, the churches of Shrewsbury are mentioned in the
following order, and their possessions enumerated: viz. St. Mary,
St. Michael, St. Chad, St. Alkmund, and St. Julian.&nbsp; And of
St. Michael these particulars are given:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Church of Saint Michael holds, of the
Earl Roger, <i>Posseton</i>: Chetel held it [in the time of the
Confessor]: there is one virgate of land: the land is half a
carucate: one man renders therefore a bundle of box on <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the day of
Palms.&nbsp; The same church holds <i>Suletene</i>: Brictric, a
free man held it from the Confessor, when there was one hide
paying tax at the time of the Conquest: the land was one
caracute: there was also half a caracate: it was then worth five
shillings; now (the completion of Domesday) four pence
less.&rdquo; <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be useful, therefore, in this place to relate some
further information respecting the parish of St. Michael, which
has lately excited the public attention, by the parish of St.
Mary enforcing a demand for the payment of poor-rates upon the
tenant of the Castle, J. C. Pelham, Esq. and which that gentleman
resisted on the ground that the Castle formed no part of the
parish of St. Mary.&nbsp; The issue came on for trial at the
Summer Assizes, 1836, before Mr. Justice Patteson and a special
jury, when a verdict was obtained in favour of the plaintiff, Mr.
Pelham.</p>
<p>1222.&mdash;This Chapel was of the donation of the Lord the
King, and given to William de Haverhul.</p>
<p>The Chapel of the Forde was also of the gift of the King, and
belonged to this church of the Castle, and rendered three
shillings, and was worth one mark, which William de Haverhul then
held.</p>
<p>1235.&mdash;The Chapel of St. Michael was held by William de
Battal, and was worth yearly fourteen marks.</p>
<p>1271.&mdash;The Rector of St. Michael proceeded to recover in
law for services due to him in right of his church.&nbsp; The
entry commences thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Robert Corbet, of Morton, offered himself
on the fourth day (fourth day probably of the assizes at
Shrewsbury) against Richard de Sarre, Parson of the Church of St.
Michael, of a plea that the same Robert should do to the
aforesaid Richard the accustomed and right services which <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>he ought to
do to him for his frank tenement which he holds of him in
<i>Soleton</i> and Lack.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1293.&mdash;The Chapel of St. Michael was worth yearly twelve
marks, and Master Adam de Malane held it of the gift of the
King.</p>
<p>1309.&mdash;King Edward the Second granted to his beloved
clerk, Boniface de Ledes, this Free Chapel, vacant by the
resignation of Roger de Ledes.</p>
<p>1318.&mdash;A similar Grant to Roger de Lysewy, of this Free
Chapel of St. Michael, being then vacant, &amp;c.&nbsp; To this
grant is appended an order from the King to &ldquo;Master Thomas
de Cherlton,&rdquo; then Constable of the Castle, to induct this
Roger into corporal possession thereof.</p>
<p>1330.&mdash;A similar Grant of this Chapel, being vacant, to
Walter de London.</p>
<p>1330.&mdash;A subsequent Grant, in this year, of the said
Chapel to Adam de Overton.</p>
<p>1342.&mdash;It appears that Adam D&rsquo;Overton was Warden of
this Free Chapel of St. Michael.</p>
<p>1343.&mdash;A Grant to John de Wynwyk of this Free Chapel, and
an order to John de Wyndsore, then the Constable, to induct him;
also a Grant to the same John de Wynwyk of the King&rsquo;s Free
Chapel of St. Julian, Salop.</p>
<p>1344.&mdash;A Grant to John Fitz John Le Strange, of
Blaunkmonstr, of this Free Chapel.</p>
<p>1347.&mdash;It appears that a suit was pending between John
Fitz John Le Strange, of Whitechurch, Parson of this Free Chapel,
and certain persons in the pleas mentioned.</p>
<p>1395.&mdash;An Inquisition taken at Salop, on Wednesday next
after the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, before John de Eyton,
Sheriff of Salop, by virtue of a certain Writ to the said Sheriff
directed, and to this Inquisition annexed, by oath of William
Banaster of Bromdon, and others, who say <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>upon their
oath that William Tyrington, late Parson of this Chapel, had
committed waste, dilapidation, and destruction in this Chapel, to
wit, in throwing down, dilapidating, and destroying this Chapel,
to the value of one hundred pounds, through the defect of the
roofing, repairing, and supporting of this Chapel, that is, in
lead, stone, timber, and glass windows, and also in the carrying
away one chalice and divers entire vestments, with all the
ornaments ordained for the said chalice and vestments pertaining
to the said Chapel, and by destroying divers images lately being
in the same Chapel, by reason of his improvident custody of the
said Chapel, and of his neglect of the repairing of this Chapel,
to the value aforesaid, beginning the defects aforesaid in the
Feast of Easter, in the 48th year of King Edward the Third, till
the death of this William Tyrington, so that this Chapel was
utterly destroyed and wholly thrown down and laid in ruins by
this William de Tyrington, late Parson of this Chapel, and so
that two hundred marks were not sufficient to amend and repair
it, with the ornaments lately being therein.</p>
<p>1410.&mdash;A Grant by King Henry the Fourth, reciting, that
whereas he had granted to &ldquo;Roger Yve, of Leeton, Rector of
our Chapel of St. John the Baptist at Adbrighton Husee,&rdquo;
&ldquo;certain lands in fields called the Batteleyfield, in which
field the battle between us and Henry Percy, deceased, and
certain of our rebels, lately took place,&rdquo; in order to
build &ldquo;a certain Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene,&rdquo; of
which he was appointed Warden, with power to choose five
Chaplains to celebrate Divine Service in the said Chapel every
day.&nbsp; The Grant then proceeds to endow the said Chapel of
St. Mary Magdalene at Battlefield with various possessions, and
among others with the Advowson of &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s Free
Chapel of St. Michael within the Castle <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>of Salop, to
which the Chapel of St. Julian of Salop is appurtenant or
appendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1417.&mdash;John Repynton, then Warden of the said Chapel of
Saint Michael, surrendered the same to the King.</p>
<p>1558.&mdash;John Halliwell took of Richard Burper, among other
property, all manner of tithes, oblations, obventions, fruits,
profits, and emoluments, of the Rectory, Church, and Chapel, of
Saint Julian, and of &ldquo;the Chapel of Saint
Michael.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1583.&mdash;Was a Fine, passing the same property.</p>
<p>Queen Elisabeth having granted a lease of the Castle and its
appurtenances to Humphrey Onslow, Esq. at the yearly rent of 13s.
4d. that gentleman&rsquo;s lease expired in 1596, when the Castle
and its appurtenances came into the possession of the
Corporation.</p>
<p>In the records of the Corporation is the following entry:</p>
<p>1605.&mdash;&ldquo;Agreed that persons shall view the stones
in the Castle belonging to St. Michael&rsquo;s Chapel, and take
account thereof, and enquire what stones are taken
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There can be little doubt, however, but the Parish of St.
Michael&rsquo;s had originally some connexion with St.
Mary&rsquo;s parish; for in the reign of Henry II. it seems that
Walter de Dunstanville, Rector of St. Michael&rsquo;s, sold a
tract of land called Wogheresforlong and a moiety of Derefold to
a person named Gilbert, reserving to himself a rent of three
shillings and sixpence; and that John the son of Gilbert soon
afterwards conveyed it to one Nicholas le Poncer, who
subsequently granted it to Haghmond Abbey, free from all secular
service, saving a rent of four shillings to be annually paid (in
lieu of the tithes of Derefold) to the parson of the parish of
the church of St. Michael within the Castle.</p>
<p>This commutation is assented to and witnessed by the Dean and
Chapter of St. Mary&rsquo;s, &ldquo;for us and our successors for
ever;&rdquo; an attestation which would appear as quite
unnecessary, <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>if this district had not once been connected with their
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The etymology of Derfald, or Deerfold, is an enclosure or park
(which will be noticed hereafter) for keeping deer, an appendage
not unusual to our early fortresses.&nbsp; This circumstance (and
at a period when little respect was shown to boundaries civil or
ecclesiastical) might have induced Roger de Montgomery, as feudal
lord, to assign it as the parochial limits of his church,
although at the cost of the parish of St. Mary.</p>
<h3>THE ABBEY CHURCH.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p67b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Abbey Church"

"The Abbey Church"
 src="images/p67s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span><span
class="smcap">The Abbey Church</span> is situated in the suburb
to which it has given the name of Abbey Foregate.&nbsp; It is
built of a deep red stone.&nbsp; A noble simplicity combined with
a massive solidity characterizes the whole structure, to which
time has given a most venerable appearance; and, though marks of
mutilation are too evident throughout, it displays many curious
features of ancient Norman architecture combined with the earlier
pointed style.</p>
<p>It originally formed part of the richly endowed monastery
founded in 1083 by Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, and
when entire was a stately cruciform building, equal in size to
some of our cathedrals, having a central and western tower,
transepts, &amp;c.&nbsp; The whole eastern portion, two-thirds of
the structure, was barbarously destroyed at the dissolution of
monasteries in the time of Henry the Eighth.&nbsp; The neglect of
after-times has contributed much to disfigure its external
elevation, the eastern portion of the upper clerestory having
from decay fallen down some time about the close of the 17th
century.</p>
<p>The present church consists of the nave, side aisles, and
western tower of the Abbey church, and owes its escape to the
circumstance of the western end having always been used as the
church of the parish of <span class="smcap">Holy Cross</span>,
the name it still retains.</p>
<p>The west front is composed of the tower, flanked by the ends
of the Norman side aisles, and has a bold appearance.&nbsp; The
tower is broad and massive; the basement early Norman, surmounted
by a well-proportioned superstructure of the 14th century.&nbsp;
The portal is a deeply recessed round-headed arch, having a
pointed doorway inserted within it; to preserve uniformity, the
exterior rib of the outward round arch springs on each side from
a Norman shaft with an indented capital, and the combination
displays much skill and ingenuity.</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Above
this is one of the most magnificent windows in the kingdom, 46
feet high by 23 feet wide; the intrado of the arch is enriched by
a series of small trefoil panels; the label rises high above it
in the ogee form, richly crocketed and terminated in a
finial.&nbsp; The window is in the decorated style, and divided
horizontally by transoms, and perpendicularly by six mullions,
into seven compartments for the glass, the lower division having
blank panels which have never been pierced for glazing.&nbsp; The
arched head is gracefully pointed and filled with a profusion of
the most rich and delicate tracery.</p>
<p>On each side of the window are the remains of a canopied
niche, which once contained statues, probably of Saint Peter and
St. Paul, the tutelar saints of the Abbey.</p>
<p>The north and south-west angles of the tower are flanked by
shelving buttresses, having their sets-off worked into pedimented
weatherings.&nbsp; The bell chamber has two windows on each side,
between those of the western front is an elegant canopied niche
containing the statue of an armed knight, bearing in one hand a
mutilated sword, the other appears to have once projected from
the body, but is now broken.&nbsp; The figure has a conical
basinet, encircled by a crown, fastened to a camail of mail,
which covers the neck, shoulders, and breast to the hips, and is
finished by an emblazoned jupon.&nbsp; The thighs and legs are
encased in plate armour.&nbsp; This statue is supposed to
represent Edward the Third, in whose reign the tower was probably
built.</p>
<p>On the north side of the church is a lofty and handsome porch,
the entrance to which is under a pointed arch resting on round
columns, and peculiarly recessed within a square aperture charged
with shields; above is a chamber (formerly in two stories)
lighted by small mullioned windows whose arches are nearly
flat.&nbsp; On each side are niches, in one of which is the
remains of a figure.&nbsp; The ceiling of <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the porch is
cylindrical, without ornament, and the interior doorway a plain
semi-circular arch with round mouldings.</p>
<p>The exterior of the side aisles displays a series of modern
gables, each of which contains a mullioned window.&nbsp; The
eastern end of the church is finished by a wall run up between
the remains of the two western piers that supported a central
tower, in which a pointed window is inserted.&nbsp; This,
however, will soon be removed, and three elegant Norman lights
substituted by private munificence.</p>
<p>On the south side the gables are at present miserably repaired
with brickwork, but it is to be hoped that ere long the public
spirit and good taste of the town will be exercised in such a
manner as to assist the parishioners in the proper restoration of
this side of the church, which presents so striking a feature
from the new line of the London road.</p>
<p>The south aisle is entered by a plain Norman arch, resting on
slender shafts, and which once communicated with the western wing
of the cloister; the approach from the opposite eastern wing was
by a pointed doorway; adjoining this is the ruined wall of the
transept, in which are two round arches, supposed to have formed
portions of a side aisle, or small chantry chapel west of the
transept.</p>
<h4>THE INTERIOR</h4>
<p>presents a majestic appearance of solemnity, calculated to
raise devout and profound veneration towards that <span
class="smcap">Almighty Being</span> to whose service and honour
the edifice is dedicated, as well as to enchain the attention to
the scriptural motto inscribed upon the north
portal&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Reverence my
Sanctuary</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nave is separated from the side aisles by five arches:
two, which on each side join the tower, are in the pure style of
the 14th century, and delicately lined with deep mouldings
resting on clustered columns, and exhibit very distinctly <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the taste
which prevailed in engrafting the more elegant pointed upon the
massy Anglo-Norman style; the former, it will be clearly seen,
have been formed out of the original semi-circular arches,
similar to the three eastward, which rest on short thick round
pillars (16&frac12; feet in circumference) of the plainest Norman
character.&nbsp; Above these is a story of smaller arches in the
same style, now filled up, but which evidently shew that it was
the intention of the monastery to assimilate them to the style
adopted in the side windows of the tower and western portion of
the nave: the alteration, however, was not completed.</p>
<p>The pointed arch opposite the north porch is partly filled by
a skreen, the remnant of a small chantry chapel which formerly
occupied this portion of the church.&nbsp; This skreen is adorned
with a series of foliated niches once enriched with
sculpture.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the church is painted in imitation of an oak
ribbed roof, ornamented with flowers, the intersections of the
ribs being finished with bosses, and the interstices with
quatrefoils.&nbsp; A lofty beautiful pointed arch, 52 feet high,
springing from richly moulded imposts divides the tower from the
nave, by which the whole front of the great western window is
displayed.&nbsp; This window is filled with a series of armorial
bearings in stained glass, restored in 1814 at the expence and
under the direction of the Rev. W. G. Rowland, M.A. from a
drawing in the Heralds&rsquo; College.</p>
<p><i>First row</i>: 1. Beauchamp; 2. Thomas of Woodstock, Duke
of Gloucester; 3. King Richard the Second; 4. John of Gaunt, Duke

<p><i>Second row</i>: 7. Audley; 8. Clare; 9. B. a lion rampant

Sir Simon de Burley impaling Stafford; which last bearings will
probably fix the date when the original window was put up, viz.
about the 12th of King Richard the Second.</p>
<p>The whole extent of the tower is occupied by a spacious
gallery, in which is an excellent organ made by Gray, of London,
and erected in 1806 at a cost of 365 guineas.&nbsp; The front of
the gallery is a gothic skreen of three arches, divided by
buttresses, and displays the armorial bearings of the principal
benefactors to the organ.</p>
<p>The eastern window contains six resplendent figures in stained
glass, executed by Mr. David Evans, of Shrewsbury, viz. <span
class="smcap">St. James</span>, <span class="smcap">King
David</span>, <span class="smcap">St. John</span>, <span
class="smcap">King Solomon</span> (as in the act of consecrating
the Temple), <span class="smcap">St. Peter</span>, and <span
class="smcap">St. Paul</span>, with their respective
emblems.&nbsp; The figures were placed in rich tracery work in
1836, but the window was originally set up in 1820, with the
following inscription:&mdash;<span class="smcap">aedi</span> .
<span class="smcap">sanctae</span> . <span
class="smcap">crucis</span> . Post . Annos . Viginti . Septem .

. Gvlielmvs . Gorsvch . Rowland . anno . salvtis . <span
class="smcap">mdcccxx</span>.</p>
<p>Below this window is a series of highly-enriched Norman
arches, forming the altar skreen, erected from a design by Mr.
Carline, and at the expense of the Rev. Richard Scott, B. D.
which has given a most imposing feature to this part of the
church.</p>
<p>The north-east window was the gift of the late Lord Berwick,
and previously to the year 1820 stood over the altar.&nbsp; In
the centre compartment is a large figure of St. Peter, and the
remainder of the window is occupied by the arms of the See of
Lichfield, those of the munificent donor, and thirteen
escutcheons of the incumbents from the Reformation to 1804.&nbsp;
A rich border lines the mullions, and at the bottom is
inscribed&mdash;<span class="smcap">mvnificentia</span> &bull;
<span class="smcap">viri</span> &bull; <span
class="smcap">praenobilis</span> &bull; <span

class="smcap">mdcccvi</span>.</p>
<p>Small windows divided by a single mullion are placed in the
eastern arches of the side aisles (which formerly opened with the
transepts); that on the north side has the arms of Mortimer,
Fitzalan, Talbot, and Berkeley, in stained glass.&nbsp; The
corresponding window of the south aisle has three ancient shields
(originally in the great chamber of the abbey) bearing the arms
of France and England, Roger de Montgomery, and the symbols of
the Patron Saints, the key and sword, in saltire.</p>
<p>In the south aisle is a beautiful mosaic window of stained
glass, by Mr. D. Evans, containing twelve shields of the armorial
bearings of families connected with the late Rev. John
Rocke.&nbsp; Underneath is inscribed&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">MAJORVM SVORVM INSIGNIA DEPINGI CURAVIT JOHANNES
ROCKE</span>, <span class="GutSmall">MDCCCXX</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>The
western portion of the south aisle is walled from the church for
a vestry, near which, on a pavement of emblazoned tiles, stands
the Font: the pedestal is carved with zigzag mouldings, and
supports a round basin, ornamented with chevron work and small
arched panels.&nbsp; This originally belonged to the church at
High Ercall.</p>
<p>Another font, found some years since in the adjoining garden,
is at the eastern end of the north aisle.&nbsp; Its basin
represents an open flower, over which is festooned drapery
supported from the mouths of grotesque heads; the pillar on which
it is fixed formed the upper part of the ancient cross which
formerly stood opposite the south door of St. Giles&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; On the sides are sculptured the Crucifixion, the
Visitation, the Virgin and Child, and a person in the act of
devotion.</p>
<p>Length of the church from east to west 123 feet, breadth
(including aisles) 63 feet; the tower is 104 feet in height, and
contains a fine mellow peal of eight bells.</p>
<h4>MONUMENTS&mdash;SOUTH AISLE.</h4>
<p>The oldest monument in the church is the mutilated cumbent
figure of a warrior clad in mail of the date of King John&rsquo;s
reign, and conjectured by the heralds at the visitation in 1623
to be the effigy of the Founder of the abbey, who died July 27th,
1094.&nbsp; It has been placed on a basement of early pointed
arches, by the Rev. W. G. Rowland, M.A. to whose taste this
church is mainly indebted for its interior beauty and
interest.</p>
<p>On the fall of St. Chad&rsquo;s and the demolition of St.
Alkmund&rsquo;s church, several ancient monuments found an
habitation within the aisles of this church.&nbsp; To enumerate
all the inscriptions on these and other memorials would far
exceed the prescribed limits of these pages: a brief survey must
therefore suffice.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>Commencing at the eastern end of the south aisle, we
find&mdash;a bust, under a Roman arch, in alderman&rsquo;s robes,
representing John Lloyd, alderman of this town, who died in 1647,
aged 53.</p>
<p>Near this is a handsome altar-tomb bearing two cumbent
figures, an alderman in his civic robes, with picked beard and
bareheaded, and a lady in a scarlet gown, finished after the
stiff habit of the times, denoting William Jones and Eleanor his
wife; the former died in 1612, and the latter in 1623.&nbsp;
These were brought from St. Alkmund&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>An alabaster tomb from Wellington old church, described by
Dugdale as &ldquo;a faire raised monument, whereon is cut the
portraiture of a man in armour, and by him his wife, with this
inscription&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hic jacet in Tumba corpus Will&rsquo;mi Chorlton
armigeri et Anne Uxor&rsquo; ejus; que quidem Anna obiit vii die
mensis Junii, Anno D&rsquo;ni Mill&rsquo;imo cccccxxiiii. et
dictas Will&rsquo;ms obiit p&rsquo;mo die mensis Julii anno
d&rsquo;ni mill&rsquo;imo cccccxliiii. quorum animab&rsquo;
p&rsquo;picietur Deus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the sides of the tomb are a series of canopied niches, with
figures of angels and friars bearing shields, on which are
emblazoned armorial bearings of the families of <i>Charlton</i>,
<i>Zouch</i>, and <i>Horde</i>; one of the friars is remarkable,
having a fox&rsquo;s head peeping out from under his long
gown.</p>
<p>In this part are handsome mural tablets with Latin
inscriptions to the memory of individuals of the families of
<span class="smcap">Rocke</span>, <span
class="smcap">Prince</span>, <span class="smcap">Baldwin</span>,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>Near the south entrance is the cumbent figure of a
cross-legged knight in linked armour, with surcoat, sword in
scabbard, gauntlets on his hands, spurs on his heels, and his
feet resting on a lion.&nbsp; It is considered to be the effigy
of <i>Sir Walter de Dunstanville</i>, Lord of Ideshale, and a
benefactor to Wombridge Priory, from whence the figure was
brought.&nbsp; He died 25th Henry III.</p>
<h4><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>NORTH
AISLE.</h4>
<p>Resting on a basement is a curious ancient ridge-backed
gravestone, on which is cut a foliated cross; under this is a
small figure clad as a priest, close to whose head is attached
the outline of a bell.&nbsp; On the right side is a chalice, a
book, and a candle; round the edge of the stone is T: M: O: R: E:
U: A, which is conjectured to mean Thomas More, Vicarius
Abbati&aelig;.&nbsp; It was removed from St. Giles&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Among other ancient cumbent figures in this aisle, one is
supposed to represent a Judge who died in Shrewsbury, being robed
to the feet, and having a coif drawn close over his head, and
tied under the chin.&nbsp; It is of the date of Edward I.</p>
<p>Another monumental statue clad in plate armour displays a long
loose robe as the surcoat, which is curiously disposed on one
side to shew the warlike character of the deceased, whose armour,
belt, and dagger would have been otherwise concealed.&nbsp; The
head is wrapped in a close cowl.&nbsp; From the peculiarity of
the robe being thrown back, this effigy is probably unique.&nbsp;
Froissart asserts that a similar dress was worn in battle, and
that this kind of long loose drapery proved fatal to Sir John
Chandos, for he &ldquo;wore over his armour a large robe which
fell to ye ground;&rdquo; and as it appears, when he marched
&ldquo;entangled his legs so that he made a stumble, and was
killed by the enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The costume of the present
figure (which originally stood on an altar-tomb in St.
Alkmund&rsquo;s church) may be attributed to the close of the
14th century; but whom it represents is now unknown.</p>
<p>On the side walls are several neat tablets.&nbsp; An elegant
canopied niche with pinnacles commemorates Edward Jenkins, Esq.
of Charlton Hill, co. Salop, who ably distinguished himself in
the first American war, being then a <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>lieutenant in the 60th regiment, and
died May 1, 1820, in his 81st year.</p>
<p>At the eastern end is a large altar-tomb, on which are
recumbent figures of Richard Onslow, Esq. (Speaker of the House
of Commons in the reign of Elizabeth), and his lady Catherine;
the former is dressed in his robes of office, and the latter in
the dress of the times.&nbsp; On the sides and ends of the
monument are small figures of his sons and daughters.&nbsp; He
died in 1571, and was buried at St. Chad&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Above this is a mural monument representing a gentleman and
lady kneeling opposite to each other under a rich Grecian
entablature; the former is clad in a ruff and long gown, and the
latter has a long veil thrown back.&nbsp; They represent Thomas
Edwards, Esq. who died 1634, and Ann his wife, daughter of
Humfrey Baskerville, alderman of London.&nbsp; Over the
entablature is a lady in a richly-laced habit, and a little girl
kneeling, intended for Mary, wife of Thomas Edwards, Esq. and
daughter of Thomas Bonham Norton, Esq. who died in childbirth,
1641.</p>
<p>In the vestry is an old painting of the Crucifixion, which was
a century ago &ldquo;turned out of the church,&rdquo; and
occasioned at the time some strife between the parson and his
flock.</p>
<p>The living is a vicarage, with St. Giles&rsquo;s annexed, in
the gift of the Right Hon. Lord Berwick, who received it from the
Crown in exchange for three small livings in Suffolk.</p>
<p>The ruins of the monastic buildings, which are now scattered
over an extent of about nine acres, are not considerable, and
will be described in a notice of the suburb of
Abbey-foregate.</p>

<p>Sacred edifices, under the invocation of this Saint, were
generally founded &ldquo;without the city;&rdquo; that in this
town occupies a situation at the eastern extremity of the suburb
of Abbey-foregate.</p>
<p>The structure is unquestionably as old as the early part of
the twelfth century; and while presenting an interesting picture
of the work of former times, has a tendency <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>to lead the
mind, under fit impressions, to the hope of a less perishable,
&ldquo;greater, and more perfect tabernacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It consists of a nave, chancel, and north aisle, with a small
turret at the western end, in which a bell has lately been
introduced.&nbsp; The principal entrance is at the south, under a
Norman arch.&nbsp; The north aisle is separated from the nave by
three pointed arches sustained on plain round columns, formed (it
appears) in the thickness of the wall, and peculiarly flanked on
the north side by square piers, having an upper and lower narrow
moulding adorned with recessed quatrefoils.&nbsp; These piers, it
is presumed, originally served as buttresses to strengthen the
outward wall of the fabric, which on receiving the addition of a
north aisle (evidently at a very early period), a communication
was then opened with the nave by perforating the wall into
arches, which are of the era when the Norman was giving way to
the pointed style.&nbsp; It is not improbable but this aisle was
made for the accommodation of persons afflicted with leprosy, to
which they had access from the adjoining hospital by a pointed
doorway, and where they might hear the offices of religion
without endangering other worshippers with their contagious
malady.&nbsp; At the east end is a curious round-headed window
with mullions.</p>
<p>A fine pointed arch separates the nave from the chancel, which
is terminated by a flat-arched mullioned window, containing a
noble collection of stained glass, executed by Mr. David Evans,
of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The four lower compartments have full-length
figures of <span class="smcap">the Evangelists</span>, standing
upon hexagonal pedestals, through the external circular arches of
which is exhibited the groined roof of a crypt supported by
slender pillars.&nbsp; Over each figure is a beautiful canopy of
tabernacle work, and in the intersections of the tracery are the
symbols of the Evangelists, <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>each supporting a tablet, on which is
respectively inscribed, in small characters&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mattheus Christi stirpens et genus ordine
narrat<br />
Marcus Baptistam clamantem inducit eremo<br />
Virgine pregnatum Lucas describit Jesum<br />
Prodit Joannes verbi impenetrabile lumen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three principal compartments in the upper division display
fine representations from ancient designs of <span
class="smcap">The Salutation</span>, <span class="smcap">The Wise
Mens&rsquo; Offering</span>, and <span class="smcap">The
Presentation in the Temple</span>, beneath each of which is a
Latin text: the first is taken from Luke i. 28; the second from
Psalm lxxii. 10; the third from Luke ii. 29, 30.&nbsp; At the
bottom of the window, <span class="smcap">Gulielmus Gorsuch
Rowland dono dedit</span>.</p>
<p>The small Norman loop-hole on the north side contains a figure
of St. Giles, and is an exquisite imitation of ancient stained
glass.</p>
<p>On the south side of the chancel is a low pointed arch, the
stone-work of which projects outside the building, and was no
doubt originally intended to contain the remains of a master of
the hospital.&nbsp; After the plaister had been removed in 1826,
which brought to view this archway, the ground at its base was
opened, when a stone grave cased with brick-work was discovered,
with part of the bones of two individuals.&nbsp; In 1685 it
appears to have been used for the interment of the individual
whose name is inscribed on the stone, and to prevent (if
possible) that ejection of himself which must have befallen the
remains of a former tenant, it is further added</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">stvr not my bones</span><br />

</a></p>
<p>Possesses much of its primitive character, being unencumbered
with pews, and until the last few years exhibited a still more
rude appearance of damp and neglect.&nbsp; Many important
improvements, however, have been effected within and around the
building, especially in placing drains around the exterior, which
have not only rendered the interior free from damp, but
contributed also to the dryness <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>of the cemetery.&nbsp; The
alterations in the nave consist in levelling and repairing the
floor, ceiling the roof, and appropriately colouring the walls
and rafters; removing the pulpit from the corner of the fine arch
leading into the chancel to the south-east corner of the nave,
and placing stone tracery of a bold design in the large pointed
window of the south wall.&nbsp; The windows of the north aisle
are filled with fragments of stained glass ingeniously disposed,
so as to represent the outline of figures. <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a></p>
<p>In feet, whoever has visited this ancient church during its
former wretched state will be astonished; it now truly looks</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As though we own&rsquo;d a God, adored his
power,<br />
Rever&rsquo;d his wisdom, loved his mercy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And its sacred walls will, it is to be hoped, no more echo
with the twittering of birds,&mdash;the sparrow find a place of
security over the altar, or the swallow be permitted to
&ldquo;build her brooding nest&rdquo; above its antique pulpit;
altho&rsquo; these are striking resemblances of the tranquillity
and peace which the means of grace are to a christian, and which
seem to inhabit the house of the Deity.</p>
<p>But the sentiment which this venerable place impressed was in
some measure checked by its disuse, divine service being only
celebrated within its walls twice a year.</p>
<p>Since the foregoing account was written, the author of these
Memorials has the pleasure to record that regular service was
commenced in this church on Sunday, June 19, 1836, which will
form a great convenience to the increasing population of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Nine new oak pews have been subsequently
erected within its walls, from a design by Mr. Carline, and at
the expence of the Reverend <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Richard Scott, B. D. who has also
contributed a sum that will, with the letting of the pews,
further increase the stipend of a minister.&nbsp; Much has been
very justly said against the deformity which the introduction of
pews has rendered to churches; those, however, placed in this
structure meet every objection, and are perfect models of what
pews should be,&mdash;fixed forms having backs, but without
doors;&mdash;adapted for a devotional rather than a lounging
posture.&nbsp; On the outside partition of each is a small carved
finial, and the whole are in unison with the style of the church
and ancient benches still remaining on the south side.&nbsp; A
new altar-piece has been placed above the communion-table: the
latter was presented by an inhabitant of the parish, and the
former by Mr. Scott.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the church are&mdash;nave 45 feet by 36,
chancel 20 feet by 15, total length 65 feet.&nbsp; The font is
the upper portion of a Norman pillar with the capital hollowed,
and originally belonged to the Abbey church.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned, that after the monks of Shrewsbury had
obtained possession of the bones of St. Wenefrede in 1137, those
precious relics were deposited on the altar of this church, until
a shrine worthy their reception could be prepared in the
Abbey.</p>
<p>On the floor are several ancient stones bearing crosses, no
doubt denoting the interment of some of the masters of the old
hospital of St. Giles.</p>
<p>A spacious cemetery surrounds the building, where the
contemplative mind,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Free from noise
and riot rude,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>may resort, and, unmolested by the vulgar gaze of
unsympathizing intruders, pour the grateful tribute of a sigh, or
embalm afresh the memory of that departed spirit with whom he
once took generous and undesigning counsel; <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and renew in
imagination, through time&rsquo;s dim mist, hours consecrated to
friendship.</p>
<p>In this silent repository are gravestones 200 years old, many
inhabitants of the town having selected it as their last resting
place, from a feeling similar to that inscribed upon a tomb in
the south-west corner of the church-yard:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Ut Nemini noceret
Mortuus,<br />
Qui Unicuique pro re nata succurrere voluit Vivus,<br />
Hic extra Urbem sese contumulandum pr&aelig;cipiebat,<br />
CHENEY HART, M.D.<br />
Warringtoni in agro Lancastriensi natus Nov. 17&ndash;28,
1726.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A stone near the south window covers the remains of John
Whitfield, surgeon, on which is recorded an epitaph, the very
quintessence of chemical brevity&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I. W.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">COMPOSITA SOLVANTUR.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opposite the south door is the socket of an ancient stone
cross, the upper portion of which supports a font in the Abbey
church.</p>
<p>From hence likewise is an extensive view of the town, with the
different churches displayed to much picturesque advantage, the
vale below being watered by the meanderings of the Rea brook;
while the more distant prospect, chequered with mountains and
woody knolls, verdant pastures and rural habitations, presents a
striking picture of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s
fair landscape, mark&rsquo;d with light and shade.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Stands on a pleasant site in the populous suburb of Castle
Foregate.&nbsp; The western side commands an interesting view of
the town.&nbsp; The venerable Castle with its towers and hoary
walls, the Royal Free Grammar School, and the lofty spires of St.
Mary&rsquo;s and St. Alkmund&rsquo;s churches, combine to form a
most pleasing group; whilst the fine church of Saint Chad, backed
by distant mountains, stands <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>prominent in the front.&nbsp; On the
northern side of the building is a picturesque dell, along which
the majestic Severn formerly poured its crystal stream.</p>
<p>The church is a respectable building in the Doric style,
composed of brick.&nbsp; It was erected by subscription, and
consecrated for divine worship August 24th, 1830.</p>
<p>In plan, it consists of a tower, nave, side aisles, and an
elliptical recess for the communion, with a vestry in the base of
the tower.</p>
<p>The tower is of three divisions, and rises to the height of 70
feet; the basement is square, on which rests an octagonal belfry,
crowned by a similar division of smaller dimensions, having a
cornice charged with lions&rsquo; heads, the whole being
surmounted by an angular lead roof and a gilded cross.</p>
<p>The body of the church is in length 70 ft. 6 in. and in
breadth 40 ft. 6 in. and has a stone plinth, cornice, and
parapet.&nbsp; The windows throughout are circular-headed, having
unbroken stone dressings surrounding them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Interior</span> is approached by two
entrances, north and south, beneath a stone cornice sustained on
pilasters; and, if not splendid in decoration, it has that
solemnity which becometh the House of God: it possesses, however,
one great advantage, in being capable of comfortably
accommodating a congregation of 800 persons, 620 of whom may
possess free sittings.&nbsp; On the floor are thirty-six pews,
the other part being entirely free.&nbsp; There are galleries
over the north and south aisles, and at the western end, the
whole of which are free sittings.&nbsp; These galleries are
sustained on cast-iron columns, which are also continued for the
support of the roof.</p>
<p>The ceiling has a good effect, being panelled in large square
compartments, and beautifully painted in imitation <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>of oak.&nbsp;
The pulpit and reading desk are octagonal, and are placed on
opposite sides of the church.</p>
<p>The eastern end is finished by three panels, inscribed with
the Decalogue, &amp;c.&nbsp; Three windows of splendid stained
glass decorate the chancel.&nbsp; The subject of the centre one
is the <span class="smcap">Nativity</span>, from the celebrated
&ldquo;La Notte&rdquo; of Correggio, and is a most masterly
production of the art of glass-staining, especially in the
management of light suitable to the time and scene of the
subject.&nbsp; Underneath is the inscription in Roman
capitals&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And they came with
haste</span>, <span class="smcap">and found Mary</span>, <span
class="smcap">and Joseph</span>, <span class="smcap">and the Babe
lying in a manger</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The windows on each side of the above are designed from the
<span class="smcap">Annunciation</span>, and the <span
class="smcap">Presentation in the Temple</span>, the former from
a painting by Guido in the chapel of the palace on the Monte
Cavallo of Rome.&nbsp; The angel, a beautiful figure arrayed in
yellow drapery tastefully displayed, is in the act of presenting
to the virgin a lily, while his attitude and countenance seem to
bespeak the emphatic words of the motto inscribed
beneath&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hail</span>! <span
class="smcap">thou that art highly favoured among Women</span>;
<span class="smcap">the Lord is with thee</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The other is from the celebrated picture at Antwerp, by Rubens,
and founded on the words of holy Simeon&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, <span class="smcap">now lettest thou
thy servant depart in peace</span>: <span class="smcap">according
to thy word</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These windows, perfect gems of the art, were executed by Mr.
David Evans, of Shrewsbury, and were the gift of the Rev. W. G.
Rowland, M.A. Minister and Official of St. Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There is a small but excellent organ in the west gallery, and
the tower contains a light peal of six bells, cast in 1830.&nbsp;
The architect of the church was Mr. J. Carline; and when it is
considered that it was erected at an expence of little <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>more than
&pound;2000, criticism is disarmed in the substantial appearance
which it possesses.</p>
<p>The cemetery surrounding the church is particularly neat; a
gravel walk extends along its sides, and the ground is laid out
in divisions for graves and vaults, which are numbered according
to a plan kept with the sexton.</p>
<p>This church is in St. Mary&rsquo;s parish, with the minister
of which the presentation is vested.</p>

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Saint George&rsquo;s Church</span> is
situated at the upper end <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>of the suburb of Frankwell, and is
dedicated to the tutelar saint of England, from its proximity to
the site of an ancient religious foundation called in old
writings &ldquo;The free chapel of St. George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present church was consecrated January 30th, 1832, and is
cruciform in plan, having a small tower rising at the west end;
it is built with fine Grinshill stone, from a design by Mr.
Haycock.&nbsp; The architecture adopted throughout the building,
with the exception of the tower, is of the lancet or early
pointed style.</p>
<p>The west front is of three divisions guarded by projecting
buttresses, the centre portion forming the principal entrance, a
pointed arch bounded by a sweeping label; above this is a lancet
light, succeeded by a panel intended for a clock dial.&nbsp; From
this part the tower shows itself above the roof to the height of
about 20 feet, and has mullioned windows in the style of the
16th-century, surmounted by an embattled parapet and four
crocketed pinnacles crowned with finials.&nbsp; The flanks of the
west end are quite plain, having in their centre narrow blank
loopholes.</p>
<p>The nave has on each side four lancet windows, bounded by
labels; and the northern and southern extremities of the
transepts, with the chancel or eastern end, have triple lancet
windows with recessed mouldings, resting on grotesque carved
heads.&nbsp; The transepts and chancel terminate with gables,
having on their apex a crocketed pinnacle.</p>
<p>The extreme length of the church is about 84 feet, and 30 feet
in width, the transepts from north to south are 66 feet, and the
tower to the summit of the pinnacles 60 feet.</p>
<h4>THE INTERIOR</h4>
<p>possesses a very pleasing appearance.&nbsp; The basement of <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the tower
forms the vestibule, which is flanked on one side by the vestry,
and on the other by the stairs leading to the gallery.&nbsp; The
aisles of the nave and transepts are occupied by free benches,
with a passage on either hand, the pews being placed along the
side walls of the entire building.</p>
<p>The font is of free-stone, and placed on a pedestal in the
area between the transepts; the basin is octangular, having on
its side compartments a small quatrefoil sunk within a square
panel.</p>
<p>On each side of the communion table are two carved gothic
chairs; and nearly the whole extent of the eastern wall of the
chancel is covered with a handsome altar skreen.</p>
<p>The three lancet windows are filled with splendid stained
glass.</p>
<p>The subject occupying the centre window is a full-length
figure of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, in an attitude
strikingly prophetic, and clothed in a brilliant vest of purple,
over which is thrown a green robe lined with ermine, denoting his
royal descent.</p>
<p>The corresponding windows on each side have spirited figures
of <span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> and <span
class="smcap">St. Mark</span>.&nbsp; The former exhibits deep and
serious meditation, with a most benign countenance; in his right
hand is a halbert, and in his left a Greek manuscript.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">St. Mark</span> is a most venerable figure,
whose head appears covered with the frost of hoary years, and he
is pointing to an open gospel which he holds in his left
hand.</p>
<p>The figures stand on rich bases, which display an highly
ornamented quatrefoil, and are surmounted by canopies of the most
elegant crocketed tabernacle work, which have a truly pleasing
effect.</p>
<p>At the base of the window is a series of pointed arches in
ruby glass, beneath which is the following inscription: <span
class="GutSmall">HANC &bull; FENESTRAM &bull; PICTURATAM &bull;
AEDIS &bull; SANCTI &bull; GEORGII &bull; </span><a

MDCCCXXXIII</span>.</p>
<p>The triple windows of the north and south transepts are also
embellished by the same benefactor with elegant mosaic patterns
of elaborate workmanship, vying in richness and mellowness of
colouring with the finest specimens of ancient stained glass.</p>
<p>The taste displayed in the execution of these windows is
highly creditable to the talents of our townsman, Mr. David
Evans, and will, we trust, long remain as a noble example of
private generosity.</p>
<p>Attached to the west end is a deep gallery of free seats,
which contains a small organ, presented by the Rev. Richard
Scott, B.D. in 1834.</p>
<p>The church was erected by a public subscription and a grant
from the commissioners for building churches.&nbsp; The total
cost, exclusive of the site, was nearly &pound;4000, of which
sum, however, &pound;400 has been vested in the name of trustees
as a fund for future repairs.</p>
<p>There are 57 pews which will accommodate 290 persons, and 460
free and unappropriated sittings.</p>
<p>The right of presentation is in the vicar of St.
Chad&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Old Hospital of St. George</span>
stood on a site eastward between the present church and the Welsh
bridge, which latter, as early as the reign of Henry II. was
called &ldquo;Saint George&rsquo;s Bridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the
year 1150, the Bishop of Coventry, considering the great poverty
of the brethren of the Hospital of St. George, Salop, released to
all who should contribute to their necessities &ldquo;thirteen
days of penance enjoined them, and a share of all the prayers and
alms within his Bishoprick.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1418 the church
appears to have been in the gift of the Crown, and is supposed to
have been taken down early in the reign of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The necessity of additional church accommodation for a
population of 2200 persons who inhabit the <span
class="smcap">Suburb of Coleham</span> having been generally
acknowledged, inasmuch as most of them were destitute of sittings
in the parish church, where many of the pews are freehold, and
others let at such rents as are beyond the means not only of the
labouring poor (who form the greater part of the township) but of
the class immediately above them, a meeting of the parishioners
and others interested in the spiritual welfare of <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>this isolated
district of the town, was therefore held in the vestry of St.
Julian&rsquo;s church, Dec. 7th, 1835, when it was resolved to be
highly necessary to erect a chapel of ease in Coleham, with free
sittings for at least two-thirds of the number it may
contain.</p>
<p>A committee was formed for the purpose of carrying the
proposed design into execution, and of soliciting pecuniary
assistance in all proper quarters.&nbsp; No sooner was this
announced than Salopian generosity was immediately excited, and
the town and neighbourhood by their contributions, in
co-operation with those of the parishioners, soon raised one
thousand pounds, which has been subsequently increased by a grant
of &pound;600 from the Lichfield Diocesan Society for building
churches, and a further grant of &pound;150 from the Incorporated
Church Building Society.</p>
<p>The parishioners of St. Julian&rsquo;s, desirous also of
remedying the inconvenient and crowded state resulting from
repeated interments in the cemetery adjoining their church during
a period of one thousand years, purchased an eligible piece of
land in <span class="smcap">Meole Road</span>, for the two-fold
purpose of erecting the new church and affording additional
burial ground.&nbsp; The foundations of the church were commenced
in July, 1836, and (under active management) the structure is now
in rapid progress towards completion, and will be dedicated to
the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>The front elevation is sufficiently detailed in the foregoing
vignette; the body has four windows on each side, corresponding
with those in the front.&nbsp; The chancel is an elliptical
recess, separated from the nave internally by a circular
arch.</p>
<p>The interior is 72 feet by 46, and intended to afford 812
sittings, 500 of which will be free, having a gallery over the
principal entrance.</p>
<p>Without further detail of the building, it may be <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>observed that
it possesses one paramount advantage, viz. <i>usefulness</i>; and
it is to be hoped, that as the inhabitants of the suburbs of our
town become possessed of greater facilities for hearing the Word
of God, they may value the blessing, and support it practically
by their influence and example.</p>

tea-garden near the site of &ldquo;Belle Vue&rdquo; was, in the
recollection of many inhabitants, called &ldquo;the
Hermitage.&rdquo;</p>

95</span>DISSENTING MEETING HOUSES.</h2>
<p>The first regular Presbyterian congregation formed in
Shrewsbury was by the Reverends John Bryan, M.A. and the learned
Francis Tallents, who were ejected by the Act of Uniformity in
1662 from the livings of St. Chad&rsquo;s and St.
Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; After experiencing the various alternations
of suffering and indulgence during the unsettled reign of Charles
the First, and assembling for some time in private houses, they
at length built a meeting house in the High-street, in
1691.&nbsp; But while they separated themselves from the
established church on account of her discipline, they did not
renounce the leading doctrines of the gospel as preserved in that
church, which is evident from the inscription set up in their new
building:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This place was not built for a faction, or
a party, but to promote repentance and faith, in communion with
all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven
and earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year 1715 was particularly unfortunate for the Protestant
Dissenters in this and the adjoining counties: several of their
places of worship were destroyed by riotous mobs raised against
the king and his government.&nbsp; During the violence of these
insurrections, the High-street meeting house was demolished, in
the night of July 6th, 1715, and the pulpit publicly burnt.&nbsp;
Government, however, speedily caused it to be rebuilt; after
which the royal arms were placed within the building.</p>
<p>The good and pious Job Orton preached here for several
years.&nbsp; On his resignation in 1766, a difference of
sentiment arose among the members of the congregation in the
choice of a minister.&nbsp; The building is now used for <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>worship by
the Unitarians.&nbsp; It is 70 feet by 30, and fitted up in the
heavy style of the last century.</p>
<h3>THE INDEPENDENTS.</h3>
<p>The place occupied by this denomination had its origin in
consequence of the schism in the High-street congregation, and is
situated in a retired area on Swan-hill.&nbsp; It is a
substantial square edifice, with a neatly finished
interior.&nbsp; On a stone tablet in the front is the following
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This building was erected in the year 1767,
for the Public Worship of God, and in defence of the Rights of
Majorities in Protestant Dissenting Congregations to choose their
own Ministers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the north-east side is a spacious vestry, containing
portraits of the Rev. Mr. Tallents and other ejected
clergymen.&nbsp; The space adjoining three sides of the building
is used as a cemetery.</p>
<h3>BAPTISTS.</h3>
<p>A society of this persuasion is stated to have existed in this
town in the time of the Commonwealth.&nbsp; The meeting house, in
Claremont-street, was opened in 1780, and enlarged in 1810.&nbsp;
It contains a monument in memory of Mr. Palmer, who was pastor of
the congregation 27 years, and died in 1823.</p>
<h3>THE SECOND BAPTISTS</h3>
<p>Seceded from the above society in 1827, and built a place for
worship in Castle Foregate, which was opened April 9, 1830.&nbsp;
They retain, however, the doctrines of Particular or Calvinistic
Baptists, as professed by the former society.</p>
<h3>THE WESLEYAN METHODISTS</h3>
<p>Assemble on St. John&rsquo;s hill, in a building erected in
1804, and which was enlarged and decorated in 1825.&nbsp;
Galleries <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>surround the interior, in which is a small organ.&nbsp;
The pulpit stands in the middle aisle.</p>
<p>A small building erected at Spring Gardens, Castle Foregate
(by the proprietor of the land) was opened Feb. 26, 1826, in
connexion with this society.&nbsp; The service is free, and the
place is used at certain hours on the Sunday as a school.</p>
<h3>THE METHODIST NEW CONNEXION</h3>
<p>appear to claim a mutual relationship to the founder of
Methodism with the Wesleyans, and retain the doctrines,
ordinances, and general discipline common to that body, from
which they differ only in the form of church government and
professed dissent from the Church of England.&nbsp; This society
formed a congregation here in 1833, and in Jan. 1834, an edifice
for their service was commenced near the Old Tower, Murivance,
which was opened June 13 in the same year.</p>
<p>The exterior is handsome, having two entrances with a Doric
portico to each, and is divided into three parts, viz. a centre
and two wings, formed with Corinthian pilasters, frieze, and
cornice; the centre terminates with a pediment, and the wings
with a broken blocking and Grecian tiles.&nbsp; The interior is
without galleries, and arranged on rather a novel plan; the
middle is occupied by two rows of pews, with a row on each of the
sides which ascend gradually from the floor, and thereby afford
great economy of space.</p>
<p>Two ends of the building being flanked by dwellings, light is
admitted from the side portions, but a good effect,
notwithstanding, is produced from the blank walls, which display
arches and plain pilasters supporting a frieze and cornice.</p>
<p>The ground at the back declining considerably from <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the street,
spacious school-rooms, a vestry, and a house for the door-keeper,
are formed underneath the building, which is calculated to
contain 700 persons, and cost &pound;1500.</p>
<h3>THE WELSH CALVINISTIC METHODISTS</h3>
<p>meet in a neat structure in Hill&rsquo;s Lane, erected by a
subscription on a portion of the site of a former edifice, and
was opened for worship Dec. 25, 1826.&nbsp; The service is in the
Ancient British language.</p>
<h3>THE PRIMITIVE METHODISTS</h3>
<p>introduced themselves into this town in 1822, by preaching in
the streets and suburbs.&nbsp; The place originally built in
Castle-court, Castle-street, for the Sandemanian Baptists (a
society in this town nearly extinct), was purchased for them, and
they commenced service there June 4th, 1826.</p>
<h3>THE QUAKERS</h3>
<p>have a convenient meeting-house, fitted up with much
simplicity, and neatness, on St. John&rsquo;s Hill, to which a
small burial ground is attached.</p>
<h3>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHAPEL</h3>
<p>Is situated near the southern portion of the town walls.&nbsp;
The exterior exhibits a stuccoed pedimented front, surmounted by
a plain cross.&nbsp; The interior was enlarged in 1826, and is
elegant in decoration, and calculated to contain nearly 250
persons.</p>

<p>This noble public institution for the education of youth was
founded by <span class="smcap">King Edward the Sixth</span>, in
1561, on the supplication of Hugh Edwards and Richard Whitaker,
and endowed with the greater portion of the revenues of the two
dissolved colleges of Saint Mary and Saint Chad.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Queen Elizabeth</span> greatly augmented her
brother&rsquo;s donation in 1571, by adding the whole rectory of
Chirbury, in <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>this county, with additional tithes and estates in St.
Mary&rsquo;s parish, which now produce a considerable
revenue.</p>
<p>In 1798, the School having sunk into a state of comparative
insignificance, a bill was passed for the better government and
regulation of the Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth in this
town, by which the management of the revenues, and the removal or
discharge of the masters, is vested in the Bishop of Lichfield
and Coventry (as visitor) and thirteen trustees or
governors.&nbsp; The appointment of head and second masters rests
with the Fellows of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp;
The school is open for the gratuitous instruction of the sons of
freemen, and has maintained a character of high repute from its
earliest formation.&nbsp; We learn that under the care of its
first master, Thomas Ashton, there were 290 scholars, among whom
were many of the sons of the gentry of the county and from North
Wales, as well as from the first families in the kingdom.&nbsp;
Camden, when he wrote, says, &ldquo;it was the best filled in all
England, being indebted for their flourishinge state to provision
made by the excellent and worthie Thomas Ashton,&rdquo; who was
instrumental in procuring the grant of augmentation from
Elizabeth, and contributed greatly to the school himself, and
from whose exertions and judicious regulations it preserved its
usefulness for many generations.</p>
<p>Many persons of eminence in by-gone days received their
education in Shrewsbury School.&nbsp; In the reign of Queen
Elizabeth it sent forth one of the most brilliant ornaments of
her court, the gallant and accomplished <span
class="smcap">Sydney</span>,&mdash;the &ldquo;miracle of the
age;&rdquo;&mdash;and in the present day, under the able
management and profound learning of the late head-master, Dr.
Butler, it has maintained a pre-eminent rank among <span
class="smcap">the Public Seminaries of sound Learning and
Religious Education</span> in this country, having produced
numerous individuals who have been distinguished <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>for their
eminent classical attainments; whilst it is an acknowledged fact
that scarcely any gentleman can be pointed out who has sent so
many pupils to the Universities, the greater part of whom have
risen into general notice and estimation, mainly owing to the
excellent manner in which their natural capacities had been
directed by the distinguished and successful talents of their
tutor.</p>
<p>The affectionate interest manifested by Dr. Butler in the
welfare of his pupils remained nearest to his heart to the last.
<a name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a>&nbsp; And in retiring from the duties
of his scholastic station, in 1836, it appeared as his greatest
comfort and happiness to find that St. John&rsquo;s College had
given a good earnest of its intention to uphold the character of
the school over which he had so long and so zealously presided,
by the selection of the Rev. Benjamin Hall Kennedy as has
successor, an appointment (it will be admitted by all) the most
conducive to the future prosperity of the school, and
consequently beneficial to the town and neighbourhood; inasmuch
as it is stamped upon high and indubitable authority that Mr.
Kennedy is one of the most brilliant scholars which the learned
editor of &AElig;schylus ever sent forth,&mdash;the brightest
star in that galaxy of distinguished pupils whose names adorn the
boards of Shrewsbury school; while from his experience of Dr.
Butler&rsquo;s system, both as a pupil and assistant master in
this seminary,&mdash;his subsequent <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>practice as a lecturer and private
tutor at College, and as an assistant master for upwards of six
years at Harrow, as well as from his own unrivalled talents and
high literary distinctions,&mdash;from his fine taste and sound
learning,&mdash;there is not a shadow of doubt but that he will
fully maintain the reputation Shrewsbury School has already
acquired.</p>

<p>In 1832 this ancient and royal foundation was visited by three
members of the royal family within two months: by his Royal
Highness the Duke of Sussex, Sept. 5th; by their Royal Highnesses
the Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria, Nov. 1st.</p>
<h2>THE SCHOOLS</h2>
<p>are situate near the Castle, and display a handsome spacious
structure of free-stone, built in the incongruous but fashionable
style of architecture which prevailed in the 16th and 17th
century; wherein the Grecian and pointed arches are fantastically
mixed together.&nbsp; The building occupies two sides of a
quadrangle, with a square pinnacled tower at the angle, partly
rebuilt in 1831.</p>
<p>The original school-room was of timber, to which the tower,
chapel, and library were added in 1595.&nbsp; In the year 1630
the wooden portion was removed, and its site occupied by the
present edifice, in the centre of which is a gateway, having a
Corinthian column on each side, upon which are statues of a
scholar and a graduate, bareheaded, in the dress of the
times.&nbsp; Above the arch is a Greek inscription <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>from
Isocrates, which implies that a love of literature is necessary
to the formation of a scholar.&nbsp; Over this are the armorial
bearings of Charles the First.</p>
<p>The upper story of this part is occupied by the principal
school-room, an apartment 82 feet by 21, and in the basement is
the head master&rsquo;s school, in which are several panels
containing the names of gentlemen educated here, and who have
subsequently distinguished themselves at the Universities. <a
name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103"
class="citation">[103]</a>&nbsp; The upper moulding of each panel
contains one of the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="GutSmall">TV &bull; FACITO &bull; MOX
&bull; CVM &bull; MATVRA &bull; ADOLEVERIT &bull; AETAS SIS
&bull; MEMOR &bull; ATQVE &bull; ANIMO &bull; REPETAS &bull;
EXEMPLA &bull; TVORVM ET &bull; TVA &bull; TE &bull; VIRTVS
&bull; MAGNA &bull; INTER &bull; PRAEMIA &bull; DVCET.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chapel forms the other wing of the building, and was
consecrated Sept. 10th, 1617, when a sermon was preached on the
occasion by Sampson Price, D.D. Chaplain in Ordinary to the King,
from John x. 22, 23.&nbsp; It is 62 ft. long by 22 ft. wide, and
contains a handsome pulpit and bible stand, and is separated from
the ante-chapel by a carved skreen, displaying a series of
interlaced arches resting on fluted Corinthian columns.&nbsp;
Prayers are read here twice on school days.</p>
<p>Above the chapel, and of the same size, is the library, a
noble room, rebuilt in 1815.&nbsp; The ceiling is richly adorned,
and panelled into Gothic and ornamental compartments, on which
are displayed the armorial bearings of the first and subsequent
trustees.&nbsp; It contains a valuable collection of printed
books and manuscripts, one side being occupied by the library of
the late Dr. Taylor, editor of Demosthenes.&nbsp; Among the
portraits which decorate the <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>walls of this elegant apartment are
those of the Bishop of Lichfield (late head master), the
Reverends John Lloyd and Leonard Hotchkiss (formerly masters),
Queen Elizabeth, King Henry VIII. Edward VI. (the Founder),
Locke, Judge Jefferies, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>At the south end of the room are four sepulchral stones found
at Wroxeter, near this town, three of which are fully described
by Pennant, in his North Wales.&nbsp; A small museum likewise
contains other Roman antiquities from the same place, with
fossils and other curiosities.</p>
<p>The windows are embellished with escutcheons of the arms of
Edward VI.&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth, St. John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, the See of Lichfield, and the town, in stained
glass.</p>
<p>In front and at the back of the schools is a spacious area,
used as a promenade or play-ground for the scholars; contiguous
to which are houses for the head, second, and assistant masters,
and ample halls for the accommodation of boarders, who are
numerous, and from all parts of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Several exhibitions of &pound;70 and &pound;80 a-year belong
to this school, to which the freemen&rsquo;s sons are entitled
for a certain number of years.&nbsp; At a meeting of the
trustees, held 23d May, 1836, it was resolved, in order more
fully to testify their own sense, and to perpetuate the memory,
of the unremitting assiduity and eminent ability with which Dr.
Butler has performed the duties of head-master of this school for
a period of thirty-eight years, restoring and augmenting by his
energy and learning the utility and celebrity of this ancient and
royal foundation, to found an additional exhibition of &pound;100
per annum, to be called for ever &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Butler&rsquo;s Exhibition</span>,&rdquo; and to be tenable by the
sons of freemen entering at either University.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shrewsbury</span> has received a
succession of thirty-two royal charters from the time of King
William the First to the first year of the reign of James the
Second.&nbsp; The earliest charter preserved in the corporation
archives is dated Nov. 11, 1189, being the first year of King
Richard the First, which recites that a previous corporation had
existed.</p>
<p>The last governing charter of the town was granted the 16th of
June, 1639, by Charles the First.</p>
<p>The component parts of the corporation were a mayor, recorder,
steward, common clerk, twenty-four aldermen, forty-eight
assistants or common councilmen, two chamberlains, sword-bearer,
serjeants at mace, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The mayor was elected annually by the majority of aldermen and
assistants, in council assembled, on the first Friday after the
feast of St. Bartholomew, and sworn into office the first Friday
after Michaelmas-day.&nbsp; Robert Burton, jun. Esq. was the last
mayor chosen under the old charter.</p>
<p>The aldermen were elected by the mayor and aldermen from the
assistants, and the latter from the burgesses at large.</p>
<p>Burgesses obtained their freedom by descent, or birth, or by
serving a bona fide apprenticeship of seven years within the
ancient limits of the borough to a freeman of one of the ancient
incorporated companies.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>According to the Municipal Act, which received the
royal assent in 1835, the town was divided into five wards. <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a></p>
<p>On the 26th of December, 1835, each of the wards returned six
members to form the new Town Council, who elected to their
number, on the 31st, ten aldermen, which constitutes the
municipal body of the town, from whom William Hazledine, Esq. was
elected Mayor.&nbsp; To assist in the local government, the
Secretary of State has subsequently appointed eight
magistrates.&nbsp; Under the provisions of the above cited act,
the annual election of mayor is fixed for the 9th of
November.</p>
<p>The ancient <span class="smcap">Common Seal</span> of the
municipal body is very curious, representing a view of the
town,&mdash;its churches, domestic habitations, fortified gates
and walls, beneath which the river is seen flowing under a
bridge; above the latter is a shield bearing the arms of England,
and on each side are similar shields charged with the cross of
St. George and the town arms,&mdash;Azure, three leopard&rsquo;s
faces Or.&nbsp; The inscription round this seal
is&mdash;<b>Sigilin &bull; commune &bull; libertatis &bull; ville
&bull; Salopesburie &bull; factu &bull; ano &bull; gre &bull; m
cccc xxv</b>.</p>
<h2>SESSIONS.</h2>
<p>A petty sessions is held every Tuesday, and the mayor or some
of the magistrates sit most days for the determination of minor
offences.</p>
<p>A general court of <span class="smcap">Quarter Sessions</span>
and gaol delivery for the town and liberties is held by the
recorder, John Bather, Esq. on the Wednesday after the county
sessions.</p>
<h2><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>COURT OF RECORD.</h2>
<p>This town possesses the privilege of a court of record, where
actions for debt (to any amount) and ejectment within the
liberties, can be brought.&nbsp; Judgment in a suit may be
obtained in about six weeks, if the defendant pleads the general
issue.</p>
<h2>COURT OF REQUESTS.</h2>
<p>Small debts exceeding two shillings and under forty shillings,
are taken cognizance of by a Court of Requests, established in
1783.&nbsp; The court meets every other Wednesday in the Town
Hall, the commissioners of which must be resident within the
town, and possessed of freehold property of thirty pounds per
annum value, or a clear personal estate of &pound;600 value.</p>
<h2>MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p>This town is a borough by prescription, and has sent two
members to parliament from the earliest assembling of that
body.&nbsp; Previous to the general reform act the right of
election was in the burgesses inhabiting within the ancient
borough, paying scot and lot, and not receiving alms or
charity.&nbsp; The elective franchise is now extended to
&pound;10 householders resident within the boundaries settled by
act of parliament, July 15, 1832.</p>
<h2>TRADING COMPANIES.</h2>
<p>From a remote period several incorporated trading companies
existed here, <a name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a> who exacted fines from what were
termed &ldquo;foreigners;&rdquo; that is, individuals who had not
served an apprenticeship to a freeman, or who were not <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>the eldest
sons of freemen, if they commenced business in the &ldquo;craft
or calling&rdquo; of any of these guilds; the chief of which were
the Drapers and Mercers: the former possessed a considerable
property, and were incorporated by Edward the Fourth, as were the
latter in 1480 by the same king.&nbsp; The Barber Chirurgeons
were chartered by Edward the First in 1304, and incorporated by
James II. in 1686, with the Wax and Tallow Chandlers.&nbsp; The
charter of the com-brethren of Painters, Booksellers, &amp;c. is
dated May 8th, 19th of Edward IV.&nbsp; The Builders, &amp;c.
19th Q. Elizabeth, 1577.&nbsp; The composition of the Tailors,
1627, and recites a more ancient grant.&nbsp; The Smiths,
Armourers, &amp;c. have a composition, 19th James I. 1621.&nbsp;
That of the Shoemakers is the most recent, being dated
1739.&nbsp; The Butchers have lost their charter, money, and
records; and several other &ldquo;crafts&rdquo; have only left a
name behind.</p>
<p>These fraternities comprehend in their incorporation many more
trades than have been specified.&nbsp; Their utility in the
infancy of commerce, as so many brotherhoods for the protection
of different trading interests, is evident; but having survived
the original purpose of institution, their advantage had been
long questioned, and the powers which they possessed became
defunct under the recent Municipal Bill.&nbsp; It is not,
however, too much to suppose but they might, as <span
class="GutSmall">SOCIAL BODIES</span>, still effect many good
purposes, not the least of which would be the aggregation of
brotherly feeling and good fellowship.</p>
<h2><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>SHREWSBURY SHOW.</h2>
<p>This annual pageant is perhaps, with the exception of
Coventry, the only one of the kind in the kingdom.&nbsp; It
originated in the celebration of the splendid festival of Corpus
Christi in the church of Rome, which was observed with much pomp
and solemnity by the masters and wardens of the different trading
companies, the members of the corporation, the parochial clergy,
and the religious fraternities of the town.</p>
<p>The procession, so far back as the 27th of Henry VI. appears
to have been &ldquo;tyme owt of mynde,&rdquo; and which several
of the guilds were obliged to support.&nbsp; This is apparent
from their &ldquo;compositions,&rdquo; or bye-laws, containing
regulations to that effect.&nbsp; That of the Weavers (anno 1444)
provides, that certain fines shall be applied to the
&ldquo;sustentacon and encreece of the lyght of the seyd crafte
of Wev&rsquo;s, at the feast of Corpus Xp&rsquo;i
daye.&rdquo;&nbsp; The composition of the Mercers, Ironmongers,
and Goldsmiths directs that they shall provide &ldquo;300 mede of
wax yearly, to be burnt in the p&rsquo;cession of the feast of
Corpus Xp&rsquo;i.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Reformation, the religious part of the ceremony was
set aside, and as a substitute the second Monday after Trinity
Sunday adopted as a day of recreation and feasting on Kingsland,
where each company had a small enclosure, within which is a
building called an &ldquo;arbour,&rdquo; surrounded by trees, and
where refreshment was accustomed to be liberally provided by the
respective trades.&nbsp; Only seven of the arbours now remain,
each of which had formerly the arms of the company carved or
painted over the entrance.</p>
<p>The anniversary has often been anticipated by Salopians with
feelings of delight,&mdash;as affording an annual treat of <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>hospitality
and good cheer.&nbsp; The town on the occasion has presented an
appearance of lively interest, conducive also to its trade; the
bells of the different churches sent forth their melodious and
enlivening peals, while the incorporated companies were passing
to their places of muster; at noon they assembled together at the
Castle, from whence they proceeded through the streets to
Kingsland, accompanied by their respective flags, banners, and
music of all kinds, most of the companies having some character
dressed in personification of a king, or emblematical of their
respective crafts, and followed by a goodly array of com-brethren
walking (as it were) hand in hand together.&nbsp; The mayor and
his friends followed afterwards on horseback, and were wont to be
entertained by the trading companies with a dejeune in each
arbour.</p>
<p>Such was &ldquo;Shrewsbury Show.&rdquo;&nbsp; An attempt was
made in 1823 to revive the ancient pageantry; but during the last
few years there has been a sad falling off in the display, and it
is to be feared that the manifold changes of the present times,
and the refined dispositions (probably) of some modern minds, are
causes that will soon hasten to a discontinuance what remains of
this ancient custom and lively picture of old English manners. <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a></p>
<p>The following extract from a scarce poem published in the year
1770, entitled &ldquo;Shrewsbury Quarry,&rdquo; is probably the
only authentic account which will afford some idea of the
&ldquo;Show&rdquo; at that period:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>What friendly forms in social pomp draw near,<br

COUNTY HALL.</h2>

<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Architectural excellence has been said to consist in
the judicious and skilful adaptation of an edifice to its
specific destination, and in the appropriate and tasteful display
of its interior and exterior ornaments, and that public buildings
should be distinguished by decisive and apposite characteristic
features of their purpose.&nbsp; How far this has been
exemplified in the Salop County Hall, the foregoing illustrative
vignette will in a great measure decide.&nbsp; The design is by
Sir Robert Smirke, and the style Italian; the main feature of the
elevation being a bold cornice resting on sculptured
modillons.</p>
<p>The principal front is divided into three divisions by
projecting string courses, and is 112&frac12; feet in length; the
portion facing High-street, 58 feet; height to the top of parapet
54 feet.</p>
<p>On examining the interior of the structure, it will be evident
that the architect has made the most of a very limited space of
ground: the different apartments are convenient, lofty, and well
adapted to the various purposes for which they are
intended.&nbsp; The offices in particular, although plain, are
fitted up in a most substantial manner.</p>
<p>The entrance hall is 22 feet 8 inches by 21&frac12; feet,
having on the right a lobby leading to the crown court, and a
room for the use of witnesses waiting for examination in that
court.&nbsp; On the left is a similar entrance to the nisi prius
court, and the mayor&rsquo;s room (appropriated to counsel during
the assizes).&nbsp; Opposite the entrance door is the grand
staircase, spacious and of easy ascent; on the first landing are
three doorways, the centre one leading to the judges&rsquo;
retiring room (which communicates with the courts), and those on
either hand to the magisterial bench <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>in the respective courts, which are
of equal dimensions, 42 feet by 36 feet. <a
name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a></p>
<p>The accommodation for the gentlemen of the bar was intended to
have been similar to that provided (under the direction of the
same architect) in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench and several
other places; but objections being made by the counsel on this
circuit, and a petition sent to the magistrates, this arrangement
was altered, and the space immediately before the judge is
occupied by a large table, with sufficient seats for twenty
counsellors, having a row of seats behind for attornies.</p>
<p>The bench is elevated 3&frac12; feet above the floor, on each
side of which is accommodation for the magistrates.</p>
<p>The ceiling of both courts is panelled and ornamented, and the
walls are lined with wood as high as the small side galleries,
which are intended for the use of the grand and special
jurors.</p>
<p>In each court is a gallery for the public, the two front
benches of which are partitioned off for jurymen in
waiting.&nbsp; To these galleries are separate entrances from the
principal front, in order to prevent the annoyance of a crowd in
the vestibule of the hall, through which admittance will be
afforded for those persons who have business in the courts.</p>
<p>Under the public galleries are lock-up rooms for the jury.</p>
<p>The nisi prius court is lighted by a lantern, which occupies a
considerable space in the ceiling; and beneath the public gallery
of this court is the waiting-room for witnesses.&nbsp; The first
story is approached by a broad flight of stairs: on the left is
the grand jury room, 30 feet by 18 feet, lofty and finished in a
tasteful manner, having a communication with the gallery in the
crown court for the presentment of bills.&nbsp; Attached to this
apartment is a large room for witnesses <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>attending
the grand jury; the floor is of stone, and forms the ceiling of
the entrance hall.&nbsp; To the right is the office of the clerk
of indictments.</p>
<p>From this division of the building the staircase leads to the
entrance of the <span class="smcap">Great Room</span>, adapted
for a third court or other public purposes requiring space.&nbsp;
It is decorated with an enriched cornice and panelled ceiling;
the dimensions are 45&frac12; feet by 32&frac12; feet, and 19
feet high, having a recess at one end; it is lighted by windows
at the side and back, and is well ventilated by means of tubes
which pass from the ceiling through the roof.</p>
<p>By another ascent of steps the upper floor is gained.&nbsp; To
the left are offices for the clerk of the peace, with a
fire-proof room as a depositary for records.&nbsp; Similar rooms
to the right are appropriated for the town clerk.</p>
<p>In the rear of the building is a house for the hall-keeper,
resting over an entrance intended as a passage for the cart
conveying prisoners from the gaol, where they are set down in an
area having stairs leading to spacious and airy cells; these,
with cellars for other purposes, occupy a considerable portion of
the base of the building, which stands upon a concrete
foundation, 10 feet thick, rendered necessary (from the
insufficient state of the ground) to support the weight of a
massive structure.&nbsp; In excavating for this purpose, many
curiosities were found; and although the required depth was 19
feet below the level of the street, the natural strata was not
discovered, the whole bed being a complete bog of peaty soil of
unequal depth,&mdash;a sufficient cause for all the fissures
visible for several years past in the external and internal walls
of the former fabric, which was only completed in 1785, at a cost
of &pound;11,000.</p>
<p>In 1832, Thomas Telford, Esq. was requested to examine the
nature of the foundations, when it appeared that the oak sapling
piles, or rather stakes, on which the building <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>rested were
totally decayed, and become as soft as the earth by which they
were surrounded.&nbsp; To restore the walls to a sound state was
deemed a difficult and expensive undertaking, even if
practicable.&nbsp; A new building was therefore determined upon,
Sir Robert Smirke having guaranteed a sufficient foundation on
the old site, by taking out the whole of the soil, and replacing
it by an artificial body of concrete.&nbsp; His plan was adopted
by the county magistrates, Jan. 28th, 1834, and in the month of
April workmen commenced taking down the old edifice, <a
name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a> and the new building progressed
towards completion so as to be ready by March, 1837.</p>
<p>The foundations appear to have succeeded beyond the
expectations of all concerned, and the building does great credit
to the contractors, Messrs. Birch and Sons.&nbsp; The estimated
cost is about &pound;12,000, raised by a county rate.</p>
<h2>THE GUILD HALL AND EXCHEQUER</h2>
<p>of the town is incorporated with the county hall, by an
arrangement with the county previous to the erection of the late
edifice.</p>
<p>The following portraits, presented to the late corporation,
will decorate the walls of the new building:&mdash;King Charles
I.&nbsp; Charles II.&nbsp; William III.&nbsp; George I.&nbsp;
George II.&nbsp; George III.&nbsp; Queen Charlotte, Admiral
Benbow (a native of Shrewsbury), the Right Hon. Lord Hill (by Sir
William Beechy), and Admiral Owen (by R. Evans, Esq. a
townsman).&nbsp; The two latter portraits possess life and spirit
in their execution, and are justly esteemed most faithful
resemblances of these illustrious heroes and fellow-citizens.</p>
<h2><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>THE
MARKET HOUSE</h2>
<p>is a spacious building, unequalled in point of ornamental
decoration by any similar structure in the kingdom.&nbsp; It not
only gives a most prominent feature to the area in front of the
county hall, but is a general and interesting object of
attraction to strangers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p117b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Market House"
title=
"Market House"
 src="images/p117s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The principal front is to the west, over the portal of which
are the arms of Queen Elizabeth in high relief, and the date
1596.&nbsp; On each side of this portal is an open arcade,
consisting of three round arches, which form the <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>main
building; above these is a series of square mullioned windows,
surmounted by a rich fanciful parapet consisting of curved
embrasures, which rise at certain distances into a kind of
pinnacle.</p>
<p>Above the northern arch is the following inscription, having
on one side the arms of France and England quarterly, and on the
other those of the town:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The xv<sup>th</sup> day of June was this building
begun,<br />
William Jones and Thomas Charlton, Gent. then<br />
Bailiffs, and was erected and covered in their time.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1595.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately over this is a tabernacled niche, containing a
fine statue of <span class="smcap">Richard Duke of York</span>,
in complete armour; one hand is supported on his breast, and the
other pointing below to a device of three roses carved on a
stalk.&nbsp; A tablet corresponding with the town arms, finely
sculptured in relief, on the left hand of the figure, records its
removal from the tower on the Welsh bridge, in 1791.&nbsp; In the
same situation on the corresponding end of the hall is the figure
of an angel in a canopied niche, bearing a shield of the arms of
France and England quarterly.&nbsp; This originally stood within
the chamber of the Gate Tower at the Castle Gates, from whence it
was preserved when the remaining portion of that ancient barrier
gave way to modern houses in 1825.</p>
<p>The basement of the Market House is 105 feet long by 24 feet
wide, and is used on Saturdays as the corn-market; at other times
it forms an useful promenade, especially in wet weather.</p>
<p>The inscription on the north end has often excited surprise,
how so large and ornamental a building could have been completed
within a period of less than four months.&nbsp; The nature of the
case would seem, that the stone-work and <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>timber-framing had perhaps previously been wrought, so
that no time might be lost, and the utmost endeavours used, in
the re-edification of a building which was almost indispensible
at that period,&mdash;when corn was for the most part brought to
market in the <i>bulk</i>, and not sold by <i>sample</i> as in
the present day.&nbsp; This conjecture is somewhat confirmed by
the following extract from a manuscript chronicle in the
possession of the writer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1595.&nbsp; In the month of January this
year the old building in the Corn Market Place was agreed to be
taken down, and the timber-work thereof was sold, and another
with all speed was to be erected with stone and timber in the
same place, and a sumptuous hall aloft, with a spacious market
house below for corn was begun, the foundation and fencing
whereof was a quarter of a year before it was finished, and the
stone work was begun upon the 15th day of June following, and was
finished and almost covered in before the bailiffs of the said
year went out of their office the Michaelmas
following.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>THE BRIDGES.</h2>
<p>Two handsome stone bridges cross the river Severn nearly in a
parallel direction.&nbsp; These were preceded by very ancient
structures, defended by embattled towers, and were excellent
specimens of the fortified bridges necessary in former times for
the protection of the town.&nbsp; Being extremely narrow and
dilapidated, they were taken down in the last century; a brief
notice, therefore, of their ancient state will be sufficient.</p>
<h2><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>THE
OLD WELSH BRIDGE</h2>
<p>was considered as the chief architectural ornament of the
town, consisting of seven arches, and situated a few yards higher
up the stream than the present structure.&nbsp; Its gates and
towers at each end were of the finest kind of castellated
building, being richly decorated with shields and sculpture; and
their demolition is much to be regretted.</p>
<p>Above one of the gates stood the armed statue of a knight,
which was removed in 1791, and placed in a niche on the front of
the Market House.&nbsp; This effigy was an important object of
attraction to the Welshmen in passing through the gate, from a
tradition retained by them even to modern times, that it
represented Llewelyn Prince of Wales, or David, the last of the
British Princes, whom Roger Coke facetiously calls &ldquo;King
Taffy,&rdquo; but which recent antiquaries have, from its
attendant embellishments, more properly assigned to Richard Duke
of York, father of Edward IV.</p>
<h2>THE OLD EAST OR STONE BRIDGE</h2>
<p>consisted rather of two bridges (being divided by an island of
118 feet broad), extending 864 feet in length, and comprising
seventeen arches.&nbsp; The thoroughfare over it in the widest
part was only twelve feet, being impeded by a range of
thirty-three houses disposed on each side, after the manner of
London Bridge in former times.</p>
<p>The further bridge from the town had eleven arches, and was
properly denominated: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">the Abbey
Bridge</span>&rdquo; for it extended to the precinct of the
monastery, and passed over none of the water of the Severn except
in times of flood, receiving only a small portion of a rivulet
called Meole Brook, the channel of which is still visible in the
meadows opposite the Council House.</p>
<p>The narrow state of this bridge having been long matter of
complaint and inconvenience, a subscription was <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>commenced
in 1765 to widen it, towards which Sir John Astley, Bart. gave
&pound;1000.</p>
<p>The expediency of the undertaking was so apparent, from the
liberal subscriptions which came in from all parts of the county,
that encouragement was given to erect an entire new bridge, from
a design furnished by Mr. John Gwynn, architect, of London, and a
native of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The first stone of the bridge was
laid June 29th, 1769, by the munificent promoter of the
undertaking, Sir John Astley, Bart; and the work was so far
completed as to afford a passage (March 14th, 1774) for the High
Sheriff, John Owen, Esq. of Woodhouse, and a numerous body of
gentlemen on horseback who accompanied him to meet the judges of
assize, whom they escorted into town over the new bridge, since
styled</p>
<h2>THE ENGLISH BRIDGE,</h2>
<p>which is a most substantial structure, 410 ft. in length, and
composed of seven arches, crowned by a bold balustrade; the
primary object in its construction was to contrive as much space
as possible for the water during floods, to accomplish which, the
central arch (60 feet in diameter) was raised double the height
of the end arches, an elevation perhaps not accordant with or
agreeable to later opinions of ease and convenience.&nbsp; With
the exception of this defect, its elegance and beauty of
architecture is probably surpassed by few bridges in the kingdom,
and is in every respect an ornament to the town, and an equally
noble monument of the public spirit and generosity of the gentry
of the county, who so laudably exerted themselves to further its
erection.</p>
<p>The ornamental parts, though sparingly are yet tastefully
disposed.&nbsp; The keystone of the central arch on the north
side is adorned with a fine head of <span
class="smcap">Sabrina</span>, &ldquo;goddess <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>of the
river,&rdquo; while that on the opposite side bears a spirited
head of <span class="smcap">Neptune</span>, the &ldquo;father of
fountains.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the piers of this arch rest finely
carved dolphins.&nbsp; The keystones of the other arches are
worked into a shell.&nbsp; The parapet of the bridge rises into a
pediment, in the centre of which (on each side facing the river)
is the town arms, and the date of the completion of the bridge,
<span class="GutSmall">MDCCLXXIV</span>.</p>
<p>The total cost, including the purchase of the houses which
stood on and near the bridge, acts of parliament, &amp;c. was
&pound;15,710. 3s. 3d.</p>

<p>The colossal statue of his Lordship on the summit is executed
in artificial stone by Messrs. Coade and Sealy, of London,
modelled by Panzetta.&nbsp; The original design for the column
was by Mr. Haycock, of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The contractors were Messrs. Simpson and Lawrence; on the
death of the former, the work devolved upon Mr. Straphen, who
completed it, and erected the elegant staircase within the
building at his own expense.</p>

splendid memorial is constructed of fine Grinshill stone; the
total expence, including the cottage and other incidentals,
amounted to &pound;5973. 13s. 2d. which was raised by a
subscription throughout the county.</p>
<p>Within the shaft is a staircase of 172 steps, forming a well
in the centre, each step having an iron baluster with a gilt
letter inserted on a small panel, which gives the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This staircase was the gift of John
Straphen, the builder, as his donation towards erecting this
Column.&nbsp; The first stone of the foundation was laid December
27th, 1814, and completed June 18th, 1816, the anniversary of the
glorious Battle of Waterloo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The column may be ascended by a gratuity to the keeper, who
resides in a neat Doric cottage adjoining.</p>
<p>From the railing at the top is a delightful panoramic view of
the fertile plain of Shropshire, to which the bold appearance of
Shrewsbury, and its once formidable Castle mantled with leafy
verdure, forms a prominent contrast.</p>
<p>The surrounding distances are replete with interest, being
composed of fine undulating hills and mountains.&nbsp; Proceeding
northward, the eye ranges over the Nesscliff and Selattyn hills,
the mountainous tract of the Berwyn, the luxuriantly crowned
summit of Pimhill, the wild and romantic rock of Grinshill, and
the gentler eminences of Hawkstone, whose tasteful plantations
and noble woods are seen at a distance of twelve miles, among
which rises the &ldquo;Obelisk,&rdquo; erected to the memory of
Sir Rowland Hill, the first Protestant Lord Mayor of London.</p>
<p>In the foreground north-east is the plain, renowned in
history, and immortalized by Shakspeare in dramatic poetry, as
the scene of the great and important Battle of Shrewsbury, in
1403, in commemoration of which Henry IV. piously <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>founded a
church, called to this day &ldquo;Battlefield,&rdquo; the
well-proportioned tower of which is easily distinguished.</p>
<p>The turrets of the modern castellated mansion of Sundorne are
particularly striking, and remind us of the beautiful lines of
Mrs. Hemans&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The stately Homes of England,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How beautiful they stand!<br />
Amidst their tall ancestral trees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er all the pleasant land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further eastward are the venerable and truly picturesque ruins
of Haghmond Monastery, founded in the year 1100, for canons of
the order of St. Augustine.&nbsp; Near the remains of this once
more noble pile is the wooded ascent of Haghmond Hill, and its
conspicuously placed Shooting Tower, beneath which is the retired
village of Uffington and its primitive church.</p>
<p>Direct east stands exalted in noble majesty the isolated <span
class="smcap">Wrekin</span>, the <i>natural Heart of
Shropshire</i>, in front of which appears the exuberant foliage
surrounding Longner Hall.&nbsp; Directing the eye southwards, is
Charlton Hill, bounded by the towering summit of the Brown Clee
(1820 feet in height), and the Lawley, Acton Burnell Park,
Frodesley, and other Shropshire hills, among which is the lofty
Caerdoc, otherwise Caer Caradoc, where Caractacus (the last of
the original British princes) is said to have displayed his
patriotism and daring spirit against the united efforts of the
Roman forces.</p>
<p>Onward in the horizon, beyond a remote cultivated country, is
the Longmynd with its straight outline, and the Stiperstones,
topped by rocks, similar to the august relics of castellated
grandeur; these are connected by the Bromlow and Long Mountain;
and the panorama terminates with the lofty mountains of Breidden,
Cefn y Cayster, and <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>Moelygolfa, which, with more distant
eminences, form a fine back-ground to a portion of the town,
while the middle distance all around is unequalled for richness
and fertility.</p>
<p>Nor, whilst extolling the environs and distant scenes around,
let us forget the immediate vicinity of the Column: its verdant
pastures, sequestered lanes, stately trees, and rural scenery,
are surpassed by none so near a populous county town.</p>
<h2>THE TOWN AND COUNTY GAOL</h2>
<p>Is situated on a dry, beautiful, and salubrious eminence, a
short distance from the Castle.</p>
<p>The front of the prison displays rather a bold appearance,
having two rusticated stone lodges and a gateway in the centre;
over the latter is a bust of the philanthropic <span
class="smcap">Howard</span>, by Bacon.</p>
<p>The interior possesses every necessary convenience appropriate
to its purpose that sagacity and humanity can devise.&nbsp; It is
spacious, airy, and well supplied with water, by means of a pump
worked by the prisoners.</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s house faces the gateway, and forms the
southern front of the building.&nbsp; The chapel stands in the
centre of the whole, and is lighted by a lantern surmounted by a
gilt cross.&nbsp; It is octagonal, and contrived that while all
the prisoners may see the clergyman, every class is so separated
as to be hid from each other.</p>
<p>The prison is further divided into eight principal courts,
besides other smaller ones; these are surrounded by cloisters
with groined arches; above these are the sleeping cells, the
communication to which is by railed galleries.&nbsp; A due regard
to the gradations of vice is strictly observed in <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>the
classification of the prisoners, most of whom are occupied during
the day in some little manufactory or useful employment, by which
habits of industry are acquired that may protect them from
temptations to plunder or misconduct when released from
confinement.</p>
<p>Executions take place on the roof of the porter&rsquo;s
lodge.</p>
<p>The prison was begun in 1787, and completed (from a plan by
Mr. Haycock) in 1793, at an expense of about &pound;30,000.&nbsp;
The entire building is surrounded by a strong brick wall, flanked
with rusticated stone buttresses.</p>
<h2>THE BUTTER AND POULTRY MARKET,</h2>
<p>on Pride-hill, was erected in 1819 by voluntary contributions
amounting to &pound;2000.&nbsp; It is a building unworthy our
town and the ample produce brought to its weekly markets.&nbsp;
In 1830 it was adjudged to be taken down as being unsuitable and
incommodious.&nbsp; A meeting was held to arrange for a new
building upon an improved plan, the money to be raised by shares
of &pound;25 each, but circumstances prevented this desirable
undertaking, which is much to be regretted, as complaints have
long been made of the obstruction in the thoroughfare (which is
often attended with delay and danger) on market and fair days, by
persons exposing their goods and marketables for sale in the
street.</p>
<h2>THE CIRCUS BUTTER &amp; CHEESE MARKET,</h2>
<p>from its situation near the Welsh Bridge, possesses superior
advantages for the conveyance of goods and general trade.&nbsp;
It was opened about the year 1822 by Mr. H. Newton.</p>
<h2><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>THE
NEW BUTTER AND CHEESE MARKET</h2>
<p>Is an elegant and commodious edifice situated in
Howard-street, Castle-foregate, and possesses every requisite
convenience for the disposal of butter, cheese, and other

</a></p>
<p>The exterior consists of a centre and two wings, the centre
forming the portico and principal entrance, which is <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>decorated
with two Grecian columns and entablature.&nbsp; The whole of the
front is cemented, and possesses an unity of parts and a boldness
of proportion unusual in buildings of this description.</p>
<p>The interior is divided into two stories, the lower or
basement being vaulted with groined arches springing from brick
piers, which afford an equality of height in almost every
part.&nbsp; The entrance to the basement is on the north side,
and (owing to the fall in the street) is of sufficient height to
admit a waggon.&nbsp; The canal is on the south side, and nearly
level with the floor of the basement, to which there is a
communication, affording a ready transit for goods.</p>
<p>The upper or principal floor of the Market contains an area of
5400 feet; the roof is supported by four rows of iron pillars;
the centre part being raised nine feet, has a range of windows on
each side, by which a proper ventilation is obtained as well as
additional light.</p>
<p>Attached to the upper end of the building is a second
entrance, communicating with an office for the clerk of the
market.</p>
<p>The first stone of the edifice was laid by Mr. W. H.
Griffiths, May 28th, 1835, and was completed by that time in the
next year, in a manner creditable to the architects, Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Fallows</span> and <span

<h2><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>THE
SALOP INFIRMARY.</h2>
<p>Among the various channels through which the stream of
christian benevolence pursues its fertilizing course to the ocean
of charity, those Institutions which have for their express
design the cultivation of the mind and the alleviation of
misfortunes which the casualties of life and the infirmities of
human nature render mankind alike heir to, afford undoubtedly the
safest application of real beneficence, being, in a measure, free
from that imposition with which an indiscriminate charity has
unfortunately so often to contend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p131b.jpg">
<img alt=

"The Infirmary"

</a></p>
<p>From the most remote period the virtuous breast has cultivated
the sublime desire of mitigating, as far as possible, the pain
and wretchedness consequent upon disease and
suffering,&mdash;hence we find that the munificence which
characterised our forefathers centuries ago was not altogether
confined to the erection of numerous places for Divine Worship,
and for which our town was early distinguished, <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>but that
the pleasing pain of sympathy prompted them also to build and
endow &ldquo;Hospitals&rdquo; for the reception of the sick and
diseased, and &ldquo;Almshouses&rdquo; for the aged and
infirm.&nbsp; The first record we possess of the existence of
such charitable institutions in Shrewsbury is as early as the
time of Henry the Second, beside an &ldquo;Infirmary&rdquo;
founded by Earl Roger de Montgomery, within the precinct of the
&ldquo;Abbey,&rdquo; as an asylum for diseased and superannuated
monks, a fragment of which erection yet remains.</p>
<p>The rapacity, however, which disgraced the dissolution of
Monasteries and whatever sustained the character of a
&ldquo;Religious House,&rdquo; has, with a solitary exception,
rendered these ancient Hospitals defunct;&mdash;nor was it until
the commencement of the last century that the attention of the
public was particularly directed to the foundation of Hospitals
or Infirmaries, and which, from the number of hospitals erected
in the course of that period, will, no doubt, be a memorable age
in the annals of Medical Charities;&mdash;whilst it may be no
mean compliment to our town and county to mention that its
inhabitants early caught the rising spark of this generous flame,
and had the distinguished honour of being the fifth in the
kingdom to form the way in establishing a Provincial Asylum, on
the basis of public benevolence,&mdash;<span class="smcap">the
Salop Infirmary</span> having commenced its salutary operations
April 25th, 1747.</p>
<p>The building which preceded the present stately erection
having been originally designed for a private residence, and
although repeatedly enlarged and improved, being found to be
insufficient for the accommodation of the additional number of
patients consequent upon an increasing population, as well as
inconvenient in many respects for the purpose it was designed to
fulfil, it was resolved, at a meeting held Nov. 16, 1826, that a
new Infirmary should be built on the site of the old one, at the
estimated cost of <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>about &pound;16,000.&nbsp; As there was, however, much
disinclination on the part of the subscribers present to take so
large a sum from the funds of the institution, a considerable
portion of which, having been bequeathed for its <i>support</i>,
was therefore deemed sacred, a subscription was resolved upon and
commenced immediately, when no less than &pound;4,666 was
subscribed by the noblemen and gentlemen then present,&mdash;a
truly noble example of <span class="smcap">Salopian
Generosity</span>.</p>
<p>In the month of April, 1827, the patients were removed to a
temporary infirmary, arranged in the Shrewsbury House of
Industry; upon which workmen immediately commenced taking down
the old building, and with such speed that on the 19th of July,
the anniversary of our late revered monarch&rsquo;s coronation,
the ceremony of laying the first stone of the new structure was
performed by the Right Hon. Lord Hill, assisted by the late
Venerable Archdeacon Owen, some of the committee, with the
contractors and surveyor.</p>
<p>The building thus auspiciously begun, proceeded rapidly to a
completion so as to be opened on September 16, 1830.&nbsp; It is
of free-stone, and of a plain Grecian character in design, 170
feet long by 80 feet high, having a Doric portico in the centre,
the ends projecting with pilasters at each angle.&nbsp; At the
top of the building, on a tablet, is the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">SALOP INFIRMARY,<br />
Established 1745,<br />
Supported by Voluntary Subscriptions and Benefactions.<br />
<span class="smcap">Rebuilt</span> 1830.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interior comprises four stories; in the basement story the
offices, to the number of twenty-two, are well arranged, having a
convenient court for coal, &amp;c. and water <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>supplied to
the several apartments.&nbsp; The principal floor is appropriated
to the board room, dispensary, waiting room for the patients, and
admitting rooms for the faculty, with private apartments for the
house-surgeon and matron, and two wards for surgical cases.</p>
<p>The first floor is for male patients, and consists of seven
wards, with a day-room, scullery, and bath rooms: the upper
floor, for female patients, has the same accommodation, with the
addition of a large and lofty operation room, enclosed by two
pair of folding doors, having wards on each side; in the attics
are four other wards, with nurses&rsquo; rooms, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
ascent to these apartments is by staircases situated at each end
of the building, connected by spacious galleries, which afford
the means of free ventilation.</p>
<p>In addition to the conveniences with which this elegant
structure is replete, <i>the patent hot-water apparatus</i>,
erected for the purpose of warming the Infirmary, must not be
overlooked.&nbsp; The apparatus consists of a boiler, placed in
the basement floor of the building, from which, by means of a
pipe rising from its top, the water heated therein is conveyed to
the highest level required, from whence it descends (in its
passage to the boiler) to what are called the water stoves,
situated in the several galleries.&nbsp; By this mode of heating
the several apartments, opportunity is afforded not only of
having a supply of hot water to each scullery, bath, and floor,
but nightly attendance to the fire is rendered altogether
unnecessary.</p>
<p>Whilst the interior accommodations of the Infirmary are highly
conducive to the health and comfort of the inmates, the external
arrangements are so constructed that such of the patients as are
able may possess every benefit resulting from exercise and pure
air, a spacious terrace having been constructed, and extending
beyond the length of the eastern front, from which a most
expansive and <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>interesting view presents itself.&nbsp; In short, the
whole of the arrangements of the new Salop Infirmary are
admirably adapted for the purpose they are designed to fulfil,
and whilst the workmanship, the materials, and general
construction are of the best description, and reflect the highest
credit on the several contractors, the building it is to be
desired will, from its site and general formation, remain a
lasting monument not only of Salopian liberality, but of general
usefulness.</p>
<p>The building was designed by Messrs. Haycock, of this town,
and the total expence of its erection was &pound;18,735. 18s.
10d. of which sum &pound;13,044. 1s. 3d. was raised by public
subscriptions and collections, the balance being made up by the
sale of a part of the capital stock of the institution.&nbsp; The
Infirmary is liberally supported by subscriptions and
benefactions.&nbsp; From its establishment to Midsummer, 1835,
the sum of &pound;164,220. 11s. 3d. has been received for its
support; 44,058 in-patients admitted, and 72,328 outpatients
recommended as fit objects for its benefits.</p>
<p>The average annual expence is about &pound;2230, and the
weekly number of patients in the house 82; and 2429 outpatients
were relieved in 1835.</p>
<p>A treasurer is annually chosen, and the affairs of the house
are managed by eight directors, assisted by a secretary.&nbsp;
The directors are chosen from the trustees, who are subscribers
of two guineas and upwards per annum, of whom four retire from
their office half-yearly.</p>
<p>The domestic arrangements are under the care of a matron; and
a surgeon with a salary is resident in the house, so that medical
aid may be always at hand.</p>
<p>The medical officers of the establishment gratuitously devote
their time and apply their skill in promoting the benevolent
design of the institution.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>The
clergy of the town officiate by turns weekly as chaplains to the
house.&nbsp; And two weekly visitors from the resident
subscribers go round the wards, by which the patients have an
opportunity of stating any dissatisfaction that may exist, and
having it reported to the board of directors, who assemble every
Saturday morning for the dispatch of the ordinary business of the
charity and the admission and discharge of patients.</p>
<p>Every patient must be recommended by a subscriber, except in
the case of casualties.</p>
<p>The anniversary meeting is held in the Hunt week; when a
numerous assemblage of noblemen and gentlemen accompany the
treasurer from the Infirmary to St. Chad&rsquo;s church, where a
sermon is preached and a collection made in aid of its funds,
which always produces a sum truly honourable to the county.</p>
<p>Several tables of legacies and benefactions for the support of
the Infirmary are fixed on the walls of the board room; and the
cornice is adorned with a series of armorial bearings of all the
noblemen and gentlemen who have filled the office of treasurer to
the institution.</p>
<p>An auxiliary fund is attached to the hospital, for the purpose
of assisting convalescent in-patients in returning to their
homes.</p>
<h2>EYE AND EAR DISPENSARY.</h2>
<p>It would be superfluous to offer any observations on the
importance of the two senses of Vision and Hearing, or on the
prevalence of the various disorders to which the organs of those
senses are liable; and whilst a general resource has been
provided for the poor in the noble institution just noticed, for
such diseases and accidents as they <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>might be afflicted with, it has been
thought expedient to form separate institutions for the relief of
such disorders or defects in the human frame as are found more
prevalent; since by directing medical and surgical skill to one
particular object, efficient results may be the more easily
obtained.&nbsp; To further this design, the Shropshire Eye and
Ear Dispensary was established in 1818.&nbsp; During seventeen
years of its progress 3583 patients have been admitted, and, as
among these several have been restored to the blessing of sight,
the institution is deserving of public support.</p>
<p>The dispensary is held in Castle-street, under the care of a
surgeon.&nbsp; Annual subscribers of one guinea have, according
to the original resolution, the right of recommending two
patients within the year; but this is not in all cases strictly
adhered to.</p>
<h2>ST. GILES&rsquo;S HOSPITAL,</h2>
<p>it is considered, was originally established for the reception
of persons afflicted with leprosy&mdash;a disease much more
common among the ancients and in warmer climates than in Europe,
into which it is said to have been introduced by the Crusaders in
the time of Henry the First.&nbsp; King Henry the Second, if not
the founder of this hospital, granted to it 30s. yearly (equal to
&pound;80 of modern currency) of the rent which he received from
the sheriff of Shropshire for the county, towards the support of
the infirm or diseased occupants, as well as a small toll upon
all corn and flour exposed to sale in Shrewsbury, either on
market days or otherwise.&nbsp; The original grant of money is
still paid by the sheriff to the Earl of Tankerville, who, as
&ldquo;Master of the Hospital,&rdquo; and holding certain lands
for its maintenance, nominates four hospitallers, who have each a
comfortable <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>house and garden, adjoining St. Giles&rsquo;s
church-yard, with one shilling and sixpence weekly, a small
allowance for coal, and clothing annually.</p>
<h2>ST JOHN&rsquo;S HOSPITAL,</h2>
<p>although an asylum &ldquo;for honest poverty and old
age,&rdquo; did not escape the rapacity which characterised the
dissolution of religious houses.&nbsp; It stood in the suburb of
Frankwell, near a place since called The Stew.&nbsp; Speed
notices its site in his map (1610); but not a fragment of the
building now remains.</p>
<h2>THE DRAPERS&rsquo; ALMSHOUSES.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p138b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Drapers&rsquo; Almshouses"
title=
"Drapers&rsquo; Almshouses"
 src="images/p138s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The generally received opinion has been that these almshouses
were founded, in 1461, by Degory Watur, Draper, from the
circumstance that he lived himself in the centre house, or
&ldquo;almshouse hall,&rdquo; among the poor people, and whose
practice (as a Manuscript Chronicle records) was to attend them
&ldquo;dailye to our Lady&rsquo;s Chirch, and to kneel with them
in a long pew in the quire made for them and himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>The
ancient records, however, of the Drapers&rsquo; Company show that
a building and endowment of almshouses by that company for poor
people existed long previous to the foundation attributed to
Degory Watur, who seems to have been only the founder in so far
as their re-erection took place, under his management, during his
wardenship or stewardship of the company, of which he was a
member.</p>
<p>The old almshouses extended along the whole of the west side
of St. Mary&rsquo;s church-yard: and, being much dilapidated and
very incommodious dwellings, they were taken down in 1825.&nbsp;
The present building, completed in the above year, from a design
by Mr. J. Carline, now consists of eighteen comfortable
habitations, of two chambers each; the front is in the old
English style of architecture, having in the centre a gateway
within an embattled tower; in the centre of the latter are the
armorial bearings of the Drapers&rsquo; Company, with the motto
&ldquo;Unto God only be honour and glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This re-edification, including the purchase of the land, cost
the Drapers&rsquo; Company upwards of &pound;3000, from whose
funds each of the poor people receive annually about six
pounds.</p>
<h2>ST. CHAD&rsquo;S ALMSHOUSES</h2>
<p>adjoin the cemetery of Old St. Chad&rsquo;s, and were erected
in 1409 by Bennett Tipton, a public brewer, who lived in the
College, and died in 1424.&nbsp; The allowance to the eleven poor
occupants, &ldquo;decayed old men and women,&rdquo; arises
chiefly from a benefaction of &pound;180 by David Ireland,
alderman of the town, and Catharine his wife; which is now
commuted to a rent charge of &pound;8 on the Lythwood estate, the
proprietor of which nominates the alms-folk.&nbsp; Previous <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>to the
Reformation the poor people received one penny a-week from the
Mercers&rsquo; Company, since which time the whole annual payment
of the Company has been only two shillings and two pence.</p>
<h2>HOUSE OF INDUSTRY.</h2>
<p>This spacious and well-built structure stands on an eminence
rising from the Severn, which forms a beautiful object
beneath.&nbsp; The site is highly salubrious, and the prospect
delightfully variegated by many natural beauties.&nbsp; The
majestic Wrekin, with an extensive tract of country, is seen to
the right; while the front presents a very general view of the
town, skirted by genteel residences partly obscured by the
foliage of The Quarry trees, which, with the towers of the
Castle, the lofty steeples of the churches and their glittering
vanes, unite in producing a scene diversified and impressive,
especially when the evening sun illumines the landscape, and
gives to it that variety of light and shadow which poets have
associated as only belonging to the scenes of enchantment and
fairy land.</p>
<p>A fine terrace extends the whole length of the building, which
was erected (in 1760) for the reception of orphans from the
Foundling Hospital in London, at an expence of &pound;12,000; but
the funds of that institution not proving adequate to the plan of
sending children to provincial hospitals, it was discontinued in
1774.&nbsp; It afterwards served as a place of confinement for
Dutch prisoners taken in the American war; and in 1784 it was
purchased under an act of parliament for incorporating the five
parishes of the town and that of Meole Brace in the liberties, so
far as concerned the maintenance of the poor, as a general House
of Industry for their admission and employment, under the
management of a board of directors.</p>
<p>Various circumstances, however, have concurred to <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>render the
establishment a complete failure, both as regards the principles
on which it was founded, the economy to be effected, and the
advantages eventually to result in favour of the united parishes,
the select vestries of which now send but a small proportion of
their poor, and those are generally infirm, who are maintained by
a contractor, at a certain rate per head per week; but
&ldquo;averages&rdquo; are still paid by the several parishes, to
keep the extensive buildings in repair, for a salary to the
chaplain, and other purposes of the institution, which continues
under the ostensible government of directors.</p>
<p>The dining hall is 115 feet in length, parallel with which is
a chapel of the same size, in which service is performed once
every Sunday.</p>
<h2>HUMANE SOCIETY.</h2>
<p>A Humane Society existed in this town in the year 1786, but,
having sunk from notice, was resuscitated in 1824, for the
purpose of preventing those fatal accidents which have been of
frequent occurrence during the bathing season, and often in the
winter time, when the river in a frozen state affords the
amusement of skaiting.&nbsp; The purpose of the society is to
render prompt assistance in the use of the most approved means
for restoring suspended animation, from whatever cause arising,
and the rewarding of persons whose humane and intrepid exertions
have been instrumental in saving life, or, although unsuccessful,
such as to entitle their endeavours to the thanks of society.</p>
<p>To accomplish these objects, watchmen, prepared with every
requisite apparatus, are stationed on the banks of the river,
where accidents at any time may be expected to occur, and
receiving houses are established, where every facility is
afforded to employ remedies for the restoring of <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>life in
those cases which hold out the slightest hope of a recovery.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that many instances have occurred by which
a just estimate can be formed of the positive good resulting from
the exertions of this Society, in rescuing persons from
drowning.</p>
<h2>THE PRISON CHARITIES</h2>
<p>were commenced about the year 1800, for the distribution of
rewards to promote the reformation and encourage the industry of
criminals confined within the prison walls; to relieve the wants
of unfortunate debtors; and to provide all those who are
dismissed from prison with a small sum for immediate maintenance,
so as to prevent the great temptation of committing crime for
that purpose.</p>
<p>The annual subscription is limited to one guinea; and the
institution has met with a laudable support, principally among
the gentry of the county.</p>
<h2>THE PAROCHIAL CHARITIES</h2>
<p>of this town have at different times been largely endowed by
the legacies of individuals who, in bidding the world adieu, were
piously moved to leave portions of their substance to be expended
in &ldquo;bread to the poor,&rdquo; clothing and apprenticing
poor children, annual gifts of money and garments to decayed
housekeepers, and the general improvement of all, by directing
commemorative sermons to be preached on particular
anniversaries.&nbsp; In St. Chad&rsquo;s parish two hundred
threepenny loaves are, on the average, distributed weekly
throughout the year.</p>
<h2>THE TOWN CHARITIES</h2>
<p>were bequeathed for purposes in many respects similar to the
foregoing, and were under the management of the old <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>Corporation; but by the provisions of the Municipal Act
the distribution of them is vested in trustees appointed by the
Lord Chancellor.</p>
<p>Several other charitable societies exist in the town, whose
object is to afford gifts of money, clothing, medical assistance,
and religious instruction, to the necessitous sick poor; as well
as for the distribution of the scriptures and the public
formularies of the established church, and for the propagation of
christianity both at home and abroad, the detail of which would
exceed the prescribed limits of this publication.</p>
<h2>CHARITY SCHOOLS.</h2>

<h3>BOWDLER&rsquo;s, <span class="GutSmall">OR THE</span> BLUE
SCHOOL,</h3>
<p>Is situated in Beeches Lane, and is an oblong brick building,
having in the centre a glazed cupola, surmounted by a flying
dragon.&nbsp; It was founded in 1724, according to the will of
Mr. Thomas Bowdler, alderman and draper, for the instruction,
clothing, and apprenticing poor children of the parish of St.
Julian.</p>
<p>Eighteen boys and 12 girls receive their education here, and
attend service at St. Julian&rsquo;s church on Sundays, to which
church Mr. Bowdler was a great benefactor.&mdash;The number of
scholars, from the increased value of the property belonging to
the school, is about to be increased.</p>
<h3>MILLINGTON&rsquo;s SCHOOL &amp; HOSPITAL.</h3>
<p>This excellent institution and monument of private munificence
stands on an eminence in the suburb of Frankwell, which commands
an extensive prospect of the town, its churches, public
buildings, and more distant views.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>The
building consists of a handsome pedimented front, with a stone
portico, and two wings attached to the centre by a row of houses;
the summit is crowned by a bell turret.</p>
<p>The chapel occupies the centre of the building, and contains a
portrait of the founder.&nbsp; Adjoining are residences for the
master and mistress of the school, and twelve houses for the
resident hospitallers.</p>
<p>The foundation was endowed by Mr. James Millington, a draper,
of Shrewsbury, and consists (according to his will) of a
school-master and mistress with liberal salaries, and a chaplain,
whose duty it is to read prayers every school day at nine
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; The scholars, &amp;c. attend
St. George&rsquo;s church on Sundays.</p>
<p>Twelve poor men or women, chosen from the single parishioners
living in Frankwell, or from the part of Saint Chad&rsquo;s
parish nearest to it, have each a comfortable dwelling consisting
of two apartments, and a good garden, with two gowns, or coats,
three tons of coal and ten guineas yearly, and two loaves of
bread weekly.&nbsp; Gowns and coats, with &pound;4 per annum and
two loaves weekly, are given to ten poor single housekeepers
resident in Frankwell, the four senior of which occupy two
chambers each above the school rooms, and are removed according
to seniority into the hospital when a vacancy occurs.</p>
<p>The school rooms are in the rear of the building, in which
twenty-five boys and as many girls receive their education, with
clothing twice a-year.&nbsp; At the age of fourteen the boys are
apprenticed, and &pound;10 given as a premium with each; previous
to which they are well clothed, and on producing a certificate of
good behaviour during apprenticeship, &pound;5 is presented as a
gratuity.&nbsp; The girls are allowed &pound;3 for clothing on
leaving the school, and, on behaving well, at the expiration of
three years of their service receive &pound;3 more.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>A
Sermon is annually preached in St. Chad&rsquo;s church, on the
12th of August, according to the will of the founder, to
commemorate his birth-day.</p>
<p>Two exhibitions of &pound;40 a-year each are founded for
students of St. Mary Magdalene College, Cambridge, eligible to
those who have been originally scholars in the school and born in
Frankwell, and educated at the Free Schools.</p>
<p>The charity is governed by fourteen trustees; and the
revenues, by proper management, are considerable.&nbsp; Well may
it be said, after reading this noble bequest&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behold what blessing wealth to life can
lend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>ALLATT&rsquo;S SCHOOL</h3>
<p>Is situated in Murivance, near St. Chad&rsquo;s church, and
was erected and endowed pursuant to the will of <span
class="smcap">John Allatt</span>, Gent.&nbsp; The building is an
elegant free-stone structure, designed by Mr. Haycock in 1800,
and cost &pound;2000.&nbsp; It consists of two excellent houses
for the master and mistress, which are connected with the schools
by an arcade.</p>
<p>Thirty boys and thirty girls are educated and clothed, and at
a proper age placed out as apprentices or
servants.&mdash;Twenty-eight coats and 140 stuff gowns are
annually given to poor men and women from the funds of the same
charity.</p>
<p>The management of the school and funds is under the direction
of fourteen trustees.</p>
<h3>PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION SCHOOL.</h3>
<p>This school was begun by a subscription as early as the year
1708, for the instruction and clothing of poor children, and is
conducted on the National system, in spacious school rooms near
the east end of the English bridge.&nbsp; A sermon is preached
annually in aid of its funds <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>at two of the churches in the
town.&nbsp; Nearly three hundred children receive daily education
here, and on Sundays they attend the worship of the established
church.</p>
<h3>THE LANCASTERIAN SCHOOLS</h3>
<p>were erected in 1812, opposite the County Gaol, for the plan
of education suggested by the late Mr. Joseph Lancaster.&nbsp;
They are supported by subscriptions and donations, with a small
weekly contribution from the scholars.</p>
<h3>ST. MARY&rsquo;S AND ST. MICHAEL&rsquo;S SCHOOLS</h3>
<p>are situated in the suburb of Castle Foregate, and were
erected in 1832, in the old English style of architecture, from a
design by Mr. John Carline.&nbsp; Two hundred and fifty boys and
girls receive their daily instruction, and are taken to St.
Michael&rsquo;s church twice on Sundays.</p>
<p>The school is supported by private benefactions; and the
National system of education is adopted.</p>
<h3>ST. CHAD&rsquo;S LADIES&rsquo; SCHOOL</h3>
<p>is held in the remains of Old St. Chad&rsquo;s church, and the
mode of tuition practised is that of the Madras system, which has
been in operation in this school since 1820.</p>
<p>The number of girls educated is 154, under the care of
visitors, whose aim, as expressed in the report of the school, is
&ldquo;to be instrumental in bringing up poor children in the
fear of God, and in instilling into them such religious
principles as may lead them to do their duty, for conscience
sake, in that state of life to which it shall please God to call
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girls are clothed annually, and the total
expence of the school is rather more than &pound;100 a year,
nearly one-half of which is contributed by the children in the
shape of earnings and a penny fund, the remainder by
subscriptions and donations.</p>
<h3><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>INFANT SCHOOLS</h3>
<p>produce a wide field for useful exertion, by forming the
disposition and giving an early moral bias to the mind;&mdash;if,
indeed, they do no more than take young children from the
debasing influence under which their characters must otherwise be
formed, and present an example of a better kind, they are
calculated to effect a good purpose.</p>
<p>Schools having this object in view are established in the
suburbs of <span class="smcap">Frankwell</span>, <span
class="smcap">Castle Foregate</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Coleham</span>, and are supported by subscriptions
under the direction of intelligent ladies.</p>
<h3>SUNDAY SCHOOLS.</h3>
<p>There are several Sunday Schools connected with the
established church and the different congregations of dissenters,
some of which have existed nearly from the earliest formation of
such institutions.</p>

WALK WITHIN THE WALLS.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span

</blockquote>
<p>HAVING noticed the principal Public Structures and Charitable
Institutions of Shrewsbury, we turn next to those objects and
ancient remains which do not admit of a regular
classification.</p>
<p>In adapting the present work, therefore, to assist the
Stranger, it is proposed to notice these and such other
localities that may engage and deserve attention, in the course
of A <span class="smcap">Walk within the Walls</span> of our
town, replete in subjects of antiquarian interest.</p>
<p>In the survey of these matters we shall occasionally lose
sight of the refinement of modern times, and accommodate our
thoughts and feelings to the days of yore, by adding such
historical remarks as may serve the purpose of general as well as
local information.</p>
<p>Our perambulation will commence from the spacious area in
front of the County Hall, called the</p>
<h3>MARKET SQUARE,</h3>
<p>from the vegetable market being held there, and from whence
may be seen several good specimens of the half-timbered houses of
our forefathers, terminating with lofty gables.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Proceeding up <span class="smcap">High Street</span>,
anciently called &ldquo;Bakers&rsquo; Row,&rdquo; from the number
of that occupation which located there: on the left of the
turning towards Grope Lane is an old timbered house, now a
grocer&rsquo;s shop, but formerly used as</p>
<h3>THE MERCERS&rsquo; HALL.</h3>
<p>Several of the Incorporated Companies originally possessed
Halls for holding their meetings and the celebration of their
feasts: the former have of late years been held at the Town Hall,
and the latter at some of the inns.</p>
<p>About the middle of the street, on the right, is the Unitarian
Meeting House (p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page95">95</a></span>), where the poet Coleridge preached
in 1798; <a name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149"
class="citation">[149]</a> and a few yards further is the
&ldquo;Sextry&rdquo; passage, or (as it is called in our
provincialism) a &ldquo;shut.&rdquo;&nbsp; This originally
communicated with St. Chad&rsquo;s church-yard by a covered
passage, and derived its name from the sacristy of the church,
which is supposed to have stood within it.&nbsp; An old building,
now the &ldquo;Golden Cross,&rdquo; appears to have been a tavern
as early as the year 1495, for in the archives of the corporation
is the charge of 13s. 2d.&nbsp; &ldquo;for wine spent on the
king&rsquo;s gentlemen in the Sextrie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its gloomy
and confined situation proves how little our unpolished ancestors
regarded accommodation or prospect when they were enjoying the
pleasure of a jovial carouse.</p>
<p>The ancient stone building at the extremity of the street was
in times past occupied as the</p>
<h3>SHEARMEN&rsquo;S HALL;</h3>
<p>since which it has been used as a theatre, a methodist chapel,
an assembly room, and a temporary assize court; and although now
modernised as a tea warehouse, the present remains convey much of
the character of the &ldquo;city halls&rdquo; <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>of other
days, associated with the good cheer, inspirating feasts, and the
social merriment of com-brethren in the olden time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p150b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Shearmen&rsquo;s Hall"
title=
"Shearmen&rsquo;s Hall"
 src="images/p150s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The period of its erection is not known; but before the front
was altered it presented (according to a drawing in the
possession of the writer) a bold pointed window in the style of
the fifteenth century, the apex of the gable being finished with
an elegant finial.&nbsp; On the south-west side a very curious
octagonal chimney, crenelated at the top, still remains.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>The
company of Shearmen were incorporated at least as early as the
reign of Edward the Fourth, and the extracts preserved from their
records afford many pleasing particulars of ancient customs and
hospitality.&nbsp; The setting up of a &ldquo;green tree,&rdquo;
or May-pole, before their hall, &ldquo;deck&rsquo;d with garlands
gay,&rdquo; was, according to an old MS. an usage practised by
the apprentices of this company on their feast-day (June 6th)
previous to the year 1588.&nbsp; The noisy revelry connected
therewith, and of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Lads and lasses
dancing round,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>seems to have excited the displeasure of the puritans, and the
custom having been denounced by the &ldquo;public preacher of the
town,&rdquo; <a name="citation151"></a><a href="#footnote151"
class="citation">[151]</a> and forbidden by the bailiffs, the MS.
further says, that &ldquo;in 1591 certain young men for their
disobedience were put into prison and indicted at the sessions,
but on their submission they were acquit of their disobedience,
and all further proceedings against them quashed, and it was
determined that the usual tree might be put up as heretofore, so
that it be done soberly and in good order, without
contention.&rdquo;&nbsp; The attempt to obstruct this ancient
festivity caused an angry cavilling and interchange of written
communications between the favourers of it and the bailiffs, so
as to raise an opposition at the annual passing of the town
accounts, for the expence incurred by the prosecution.</p>
<p>In the reign of Elizabeth, six hundred shearmen or
cloth-workers were occupied (under the drapers) in dressing or
raising the wool on one side of a coarse kind of cloth called
Welsh webs, which were brought from Merionethshire and
Montgomeryshire to a weekly market in this town.</p>
<p>This manner of raising the wool having been found to <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>weaken the
texture of the cloths, the avocation of the company became
useless and was discontinued.</p>
<p>Leaving St. Julian&rsquo;s Church (p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page59">59</a></span>) on the left,
we arrive at the <span class="smcap">Wyle Cop</span>,&mdash;cop
is the Saxon word for top, or head of any thing, and this part is
considered as the first portion of the town inhabited by the
early British settlers, being situated near the royal dwelling of
Brochwel (the site of Old St. Chad&rsquo;s church).&nbsp; The
Saxons, on their possession of the town, continued (without
doubt) for a time to occupy the huts abandoned by the
Britons.&nbsp; From hence the town extended itself northward in
the direction of the churches.&nbsp; Proceeding down the Wyle
Cop, we pass the <span class="smcap">Lion Hotel</span>, four
doors below is the house which formed the temporary residence of
King Henry the Seventh, who, although he left the bailiffs to pay
his soldiers, did not forget the favour conferred upon him by the
burgesses.&nbsp; From this place is a pretty distant view of the
Wrekin, Lord Hill&rsquo;s Column, &amp;c.&nbsp; At the foot of
the Wyle, and turning to the right, we leave on the left the
precinct of the <span class="smcap">Grey Friars</span>, and pass
along <i>Beeches Lane</i>, anciently <i>Bispestan</i> and
<i>Bushpestanes</i>, in which is the Blue School and the Roman
Catholic Chapel, and arrive at</p>
<h3>THE TOWN WALLS,</h3>
<p>erected in the time of Henry the Third, to fortify the place
against the inroads of the Welsh, and towards the completion of
which the burgesses were materially assisted by the royal
bounty.&nbsp; These walls, although now deprived of their
battlements, form an excellent footpath, and afford a delightful
view of the river and adjacent country.&nbsp; At the extremity of
the Walls is the <i>Crescent</i>; and a little beyond stands the
only remaining Tower of nearly twenty which formerly strengthened
the ancient ramparts that enclosed our town.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>It is
square, and of three stories, embattled at the summit, and
lighted by narrow square windows; from the style of building, it
is probably as old as the reign of Henry the Fourth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p153b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Old Tower"
title=
"The Old Tower"
 src="images/p153s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Nearly adjoining the Tower is the Meeting-house of the
Methodist New Connexion; and further on to the right is <i>Swan
Hill</i>, formerly called <i>Murivance</i>, signifying before or
within the walls.&nbsp; Passing Allatt&rsquo;s School, a chaste
freestone building, the turning to the right leads to <i>St.
John&rsquo;s Hill</i>, chiefly occupied by private
individuals.&nbsp; Proceeding onwards, St. Chad&rsquo;s church
breaks upon the view, having a terrace on the south-west side
which commands a fine prospect of the beautiful <span
class="smcap">Quarry Walk</span>.&nbsp; Leaving the principal
entrance to this delightful promenade, a broad thoroughfare leads
to the handsome residences of <i>Claremont Buildings</i>.&nbsp;
Continuing our route to the end of this street, a narrow way
opens to St. Austin&rsquo;s Friars and the <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>river, on
the margin of which once stood an out-work, flanked by two round
towers, erected by the corporation at a remote period for the
protection of the opposite ford.&nbsp; In later times one of
these towers was called the &ldquo;Round House,&rdquo; and was
demolished about forty years ago.&nbsp; Turning to the right, we
observe the remnant of the house of</p>
<h3>THE AUSTIN FRIARS,</h3>
<p>of which little appears excepting the outer portion of a red
stone building, now used as a tan-house.&nbsp; The Friars
Eremites of St. Augustine are supposed to have located in this
town about the middle of the thirteenth century, and erected
their house on a site which had been used during the reign of
John as a place of sepulture, interment in consecrated ground
having for a period been forbidden by that king.</p>
<p>The following beautiful initial letter, affixed to a <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>charter
from Edward the Third, in 1345, assigns to the friars of this
convent the out-work above alluded to, under certain conditions,
with leave to have a postern gate for ingress and egress towards
their house and church.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The king is depicted as sitting upon his throne, holding a
globe in his left and a sceptre in his right hand, with two
friars kneeling before him, and a third presenting a book or
charter.</p>
<p>In the church of this Priory was a sanctuary, where a murderer
could take refuge, and thereby escape his merited punishment; and
several knights and men of rank, slain in the battle of
Shrewsbury, were buried within its walls.</p>
<p>Previously to the dissolution, this house, like many others,
fell suddenly into a state of bankruptcy, and the church was
stripped of its furniture and vestments.&nbsp; On the site of the
precinct which once pertained to this friary, and extended to the
Quarry walk, several good houses have been erected.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the river is the suburb of Frankwell,
bordered with gardens; Millington&rsquo;s Hospital crowning the
eminence.</p>
<h3>THE WELSH BRIDGE</h3>
<p>next attracts attention.&nbsp; It is a bold and substantial
structure, completed in 1795, from a design by Messrs. Tilley and
Carline, of this town, at a cost of &pound;8000.&nbsp; It
consists of five semi-circular arches, surmounted with a
balustrade, and is 266 feet in length and 30 in breadth.</p>
<p>It has been truly remarked, that while in cities of greater
commercial importance no public works of great extent have been
carried on without the exaction of tolls and contributions, the
inhabitants of this town and county have, to their immortal
honour, erected two noble bridges, by which the trade of the
neighbouring districts has been <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>released from the burthen of a
vexatious tax, at a total expence of full &pound;30,000, the
whole of which was raised by voluntary contribution.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p156b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Welsh Bridge"
title=
"The Welsh Bridge"
 src="images/p156s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It is, however, matter of regret that too little attention has
been shewn to encroachments on the river, by which much of the
beauty of our bridges has been destroyed.</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>Adjoining the Welsh bridge are quays and spacious
warehouses, from whence the barges and trows receive and
discharge their cargoes.&nbsp; This end of the town formerly
displayed a scene of commercial importance, as being the place
where the London, Birmingham, and Manchester waggons arrived, and
from whence goods were forwarded to all parts of the kingdom; but
owing to the communication opened with the above-mentioned places
by the Shrewsbury canal, which terminates in the Castle-foregate,
most of the goods arrive there; this part, therefore, retains
little more of its former bustle than is occasioned by the
arrival of waggons for the dispatch of merchandize into North
Wales, and what remains of the Severn trade.</p>
<p>From hence we proceed up the street called <span
class="smcap">Mardol</span>; about half-way up, on the right, is
<span class="smcap">Hill&rsquo;s Lane</span>, where is
situated</p>
<h3>ROWLEY&rsquo;S MANSION,</h3>
<p>said to be the first brick structure erected in
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It appears to have been built in 1618 by
William Rowley, draper, and the first of his family who settled
in this town, of which he was admitted a burgess in 1594, and
made an alderman in 1633, under the charter of Charles the
First.&nbsp; His grand-daughter and co-heiress married John Hill,
Esq. who lived in great hospitality in this mansion, from whom
the street received the appellation of <i>Hill&rsquo;s Lane</i>,
instead of Knuckin-street.&nbsp; He died in 1731, and the house
was soon afterwards inhabited by the talented Dr. Adams,
incumbent of St. Chad&rsquo;s from 1731 to 1775.</p>
<p>The portal of this mansion is curious, and is accurately
delineated by the wood cut.&nbsp; The great chamber, or
withdrawing room, remains nearly in its original state, and is
adorned with a basso relievo representation of the Creation, <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>and other
devices in stucco, &amp;c.&nbsp; The oak wainscot from the other
apartments has lately been removed.&nbsp; It is now used as a
storehouse for grain, and presents a striking picture
of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Some banquet Hall
deserted,<br />
Whose lights are fled, whose glory&rsquo;s dead,<br />
And all but it departed.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Retracing our steps to Mardol, at the top of the street is a
pile of ancient houses, decorated on the exterior with <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>plaster and
stone ornaments, in the fantastical fashion of the time in which
they were built.&nbsp; The turning below these leads to
<i>Claremont Street</i>, formerly Doglane.&nbsp; On the left is a
curious half-timbered house, built in 1613, with a projecting
porch.&nbsp; A little lower is the Baptist Meeting House.&nbsp;
Keeping to the left, is an old mansion, called</p>
<h3>THE BELL STONE,</h3>
<p>from a large stone which formerly stood outside the wall that
surrounded the portion of the court not occupied by the
buildings.&nbsp; The stone is now removed to the area in front of
the house, which before the recent alteration was a good specimen
of the smaller mansion of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; It
was erected by Edward Owen, Esq. a bailiff of the town in
1582.</p>
<p>Leaving the new Theatre on the right, we enter the street
called <span class="smcap">Shoplatch</span>, a name supposed to
be derived from <span class="smcap">Shutt Place</span>, the
residence of an ancient Shrewsbury family of the name of Shutt,
the remains of which are still to be traced in the massive walls
of a stone edifice long disused, however, for domestic purposes,
and arrive at Mardol Head, formerly called <span
class="smcap">The Stalls</span>.&nbsp; At the corner leading to
High-street is</p>
<h3>IRELAND&rsquo;S MANSION,</h3>
<p>once the town residence of the ancient family of Ireland, long
seated at Albrighton.&nbsp; It is a spacious half-timbered
building, four stories high, finished with gables, on the beams
of which are the following armorial bearings&mdash;Gules, three
fleurs de lis, three, two, and one, Argent.&nbsp; The front
consists of four ranges of bay windows, the original entrance
having been in the centre under a Tudor arch.&nbsp; It is now
divided into three excellent dwellings.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>Passing up <span class="smcap">Pride Hill</span>,
formerly called Corvisors&rsquo; Row, we reach the High Pavement,
where, opposite the present Butter and Poultry Market, once
stood</p>
<h3>THE HIGH CROSS,</h3>
<p>which was no doubt similar in design to the elegant structures
at Chichester and other places.&nbsp; It appears to have escaped
the iconoclastic zeal of the puritans; for we learn that the old
stone cross was not taken down until the year 1705.&nbsp; All
general proclamations, as in former times, are still made upon
this spot, whilst the reminiscences connected with it afford a
melancholy picture of feudal severity.&nbsp; Here David, the last
of the British Princes, underwent his cruel sentence, for
defending by force of arms the liberties of his native country;
and here the Earl of Worcester and other distinguished noblemen,
after the battle of Shrewsbury, atoned for their rebellion by the
loss of their heads.</p>
<p>Continuing our course, we enter <span class="smcap">Castle
Street</span>, which is terminated in a picturesque manner by
Laura&rsquo;s tower on the Castle mount, and the umbrageous
foliage with which it is surrounded.&nbsp; At the extremity of
this spacious street stands</p>
<h3>ST. NICHOLAS&rsquo;S CHAPEL,</h3>
<p>the only one existing of eight similar structures.&nbsp; Its
present appearance proves it to be of Norman foundation, and
built probably by Earl Roger de Montgomery for the accommodation
of such of his retainers as resided in the <i>outer court</i> of
the castle within which it once stood.&nbsp; It was subsequently
appropriated for the accommodation of the President and Council
of the Marches of Wales.&nbsp; The west end displays a pointed
window divided by a mullion, and in the interior is a massive
semi-circular arch, which separated the nave from a chancel now
destroyed.&nbsp; In lowering the floor <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>in 1825,
several human skulls and bones were discovered.&nbsp; The
building is 50 feet long, by 19 wide, and is used at present as a
coach-house and stable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>To the right of this edifice is a handsome timber gateway,
erected in 1620, which leads to</p>
<h3>THE COUNCIL HOUSE,</h3>
<p>or <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s Place</span>, originally
occupied as the residence of <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>the Court of the Marches of Wales;
the Lords President and Council of which, in assembling,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;With
temper&rsquo;d awe to guide<br />
An old and haughty nation proud in arms,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>were frequently received here &ldquo;righte royallie&rdquo; by
the corporation and trading companies; the latter, no doubt,
considering that the great number of persons which this Court
attracted to the town in its judicial capacity, independent of
the attendant pomp and feasting, was of no small benefit to them
in their respective crafts and occupations, by multiplying the
consumption of the necessaries of life, and imparting to
Shrewsbury somewhat of the importance of a second capital.</p>
<p>In the early part of the rebellion, the Corporation sent an
invitation to Charles the First, stating that he should
&ldquo;have free access into the town, and be entertained in the
best manner these troublesome times afford.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
unfortunate monarch accepted the loyal offer of his Salopian
subjects, and arrived here Sept. 20th, 1642, attended by his two
sons (the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York) and his nephew
Prince Rupert, where he resided for the space of six weeks.&nbsp;
King James the Second also kept his court here in 1687.</p>
<p>In 1583 the Corporation granted to Richard Barker, Esq.
town-clerk of Shrewsbury, their interest in the council house and
adjoining chapel, reserving the use of it for the annual
residence of her Majesty&rsquo;s Council.&nbsp; From him it
passed to Thomas Owen, Esq. also town-clerk, in whose family it
remained until it was purchased by Richard Lyster, Esq. to whose
descendant, Henry Lyster, of Rowton Castle, Esq. it now belongs.

<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>The
building stands on an eminence overhanging the river in the
vicinity of the castle, in what is supposed to have been the
outer ballium of that fortress.&nbsp; Its erection took place
about the time of Henry the Seventh, and it was soon afterwards
considerably enlarged in all probability with some of the
materials from the castle and the adjoining convent of Black
Friars.&nbsp; On the extinction of the Court of the Marches in
1689, these extensive buildings became ruinous, and their remains
have been (during the present century) converted into three good
houses, which command delightful prospects.&nbsp; The hall and
great chamber above form a portion of the residence of Dr. Du
Gard, who has displayed a commendable taste in preserving as far
as possible the character of this part of the building.</p>
<p>Returning along Castle Street, on the right is the Raven
Hotel, where Lieut. Geo. Farquhar (in 1704 or 1705) wrote his
comedy of &ldquo;The Recruiting Officer,&rdquo; the scene of
which is laid in Shrewsbury; and while it sufficiently
demonstrates he was well acquainted with that gay scene of life
which forms the subject of his play, it is equally certain he had
&ldquo;living originals in his eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; The epistle
dedicatory is &ldquo;To all friends round the Wrekin,&rdquo; and
states he was a perfect stranger to every thing in Salop but its
character of loyalty, the number of its inhabitants, and their
generous and hospitable reception of strangers,&mdash;an
eulogium, it is devoutly to be wished, may be retained by
Salopians in every generation.</p>
<p>Taking the direction of the street opposite the Raven, a
pleasing view of ancient and modern architecture presents <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>itself, in
St. Mary&rsquo;s church and the Infirmary.&nbsp; On the
south-west side of the church-yard is</p>
<h3>THE DRAPERS&rsquo; HALL,</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p164b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Drapers&rsquo; Hall, Interior View"
title=
"Drapers&rsquo; Hall, Interior View"

</a></p>
<p>a half-timbered building, erected probably about the time of
Elizabeth.&nbsp; The interior is sufficiently described by the
accompanying engraving, presented by the liberality of the <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Drapers&rsquo; Company.&nbsp; The apartment is 28 feet
by 20, but was originally of larger dimensions.&nbsp; It is
wainscotted with fine old oak, and the floor was once rich in
emblazoned tiles.&nbsp; At the north end is the upper place, or
&ldquo;dais,&rdquo; where the members &ldquo;feasted full and
high;&rdquo; and on the opposite side stands a fine old chest,
with richly carved ornaments; above which is a painting said to
represent the first steward of the company, Degory Watur, and his
wife; this originally stood on the front of the hall house
occupied by Degory in the almshouses.</p>
<p>The east side is decorated with a portrait of Edward the
Fourth, denoting round the circumference his titles and decease

<p>Returning from this hall, which is the only one appropriated
to its original purpose, to the left is <span
class="smcap">Dogpole</span> (from Doke or Duck, to decline, and
Poll, the head or summit); the street having an abrupt descent
towards the river, to which there was formerly a
communication.</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>To
the right is St. Mary&rsquo;s Street and the Almshouses.&nbsp;
This street was very narrow until the year 1824, when several old
buildings were taken down.&nbsp; Pursuing our course along <span
class="smcap">Church Street</span>, we pass the site and remnant
of a half-timbered house, distinguished by gables, which formed a
portion of</p>
<h3>JONES&rsquo;S MANSION,</h3>
<p>in which the Duke of York resided when he accompanied his
royal father to this town in 1642.&nbsp; It was also the abode of
&ldquo;Prince Rupert, when he joined his uncle after the
brilliant action of Worcester.&rdquo;&nbsp; This house was built
by Thos. Jones, Esq. whose burial is noticed in the account of
the adjoining church of St. Alkmond.&nbsp; Leaving that sacred
edifice to the left, and turning a few yards to the right, we
arrive at the <span class="smcap">Double Butcher Row</span>, a
street chiefly occupied by butcher&rsquo;s shambles, and where is
an</p>
<h3>ANCIENT TIMBER HOUSE,</h3>
<p>considered to be one of the oldest and largest of this kind of
buildings of which our town displays so many specimens.</p>
<p>The projecting stories are sustained by elegant brackets, and
the angle uprights enriched with small pointed arches, carved
with trefoil and other decorations.&nbsp; Along the front
basement is a cloister of wooden arches obtusely
pointed.&mdash;This building, 60 feet in length, is now divided
into smaller habitations.&nbsp; History is silent as to the time,
or by whom this edifice was erected, nor have we any decided
information of its primary occupancy.</p>
<p>From the appearance of the cloister, it has been conjectured
that it was a religious house, inhabited by the chauntry priests
of the fraternity of the Holy Cross in St. Alkmund&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; But from its extent it is more likely to have been
the town mansion of the Abbot of Lilleshull, who <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>had a
residence in this part of the parish, and to which monastery the
patronage of the church belonged.</p>

<p>Continuing our route to the left of this house, we pass steps
leading to the churchyard, and the foundations of a stone
building (which once pertained to an <i>Oriel</i> and the ancient
college of St. Alkmond), into Fish-street, occupied by shambles,
and on market-days by the country butchers.&nbsp; Crossing the
top of High-street, we enter Milk-street, which leads to Old St.
Chad&rsquo;s (page 28), and the street called <span

<h3><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>THE
JUDGES&rsquo; HOUSE,</h3>
<p>purchased by the County of Salop in 1821, under an act for
providing suitable accommodation for the reception of his
Majesty&rsquo;s judges of assize.&nbsp; At the south-west end of
the opposite thoroughfare across the church-yard is the remains
of a red stone wall which formed part of</p>
<h3>THE COLLEGE OF ST. CHAD,</h3>
<p>originally a large ancient building inclosing a quadrangular
court, separated from the street by a lofty wall and gateway, In
1549 Edward the Sixth granted the college to Hugh Edwards, Esq.
the individual who (in 1551) exerted himself in obtaining the
foundation of our grammar school.&nbsp; It continued in his
family until 1752, when Lord and Lady Malpas disposed of the
buildings, which were soon afterwards converted into three
excellent houses, but so effectually modernized with brick as to
display none of the appearance of a &ldquo;college,&rdquo;
although the name is still retained.</p>
<p>Westward is College Hill.&nbsp; Half-way down this street, a
modern Gothic front denotes</p>
<h3>VAUGHAN&rsquo;S PLACE,</h3>
<p>which, before its alteration and brick casing in 1795, was
considered a most curious specimen of the unembattled town
mansion, erected (it is conjectured) about the middle of the
fourteenth century by Sir Hamo Vaughan, whose daughter Eleanor
married Reginald de Mutton.&nbsp; By this alliance the house came
into the possession of the Myttons of Halston, several of whom
represented this town in parliament; but little of its original
state now appears.&nbsp; The hall is approached from a passage
near the Corn-market by a flight of steps, and displays a
deeply-recessed pointed arch; a similar one is seen from the
College-hill entrance.&nbsp; One portion of the building forms
the <span class="smcap">Watch Room</span> and <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span><span
class="smcap">Police Station</span> of the town, and some of the
spacious vaults beneath are used as a temporary receptacle for
midnight disorderlies.</p>
<p>Nearly adjoining, in the street leading to the Corn-market, is
the <span class="smcap">Talbot Hotel</span>, where the Duchess of
Kent and the Princess Victoria alighted on their visit to this
town in 1832, on which occasion the mayor and corporation waited
upon them with a congratulatory address.</p>
<h2>LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS.</h2>
<h3>SHROPSHIRE AND NORTH WALES NATURAL HISTORY AND ANTIQUARIAN
SOCIETY.</h3>
<p>At a meeting held at Shrewsbury on the 26th of June, 1835, it
was resolved to establish a Natural History Society for the
county of Salop and North Wales, and to found a central museum
and scientific library.</p>
<p>In order to secure the perpetuity of the institution, and to
guard against the possible dispersion of the museum at any future
period, the property of the society is vested in the lords
lieutenant of the county of Salop, and of the several counties of
North Wales, as trustees, for the permanent use and benefit of
the district at large.</p>
<p>The museum is principally designed to illustrate the Natural
History of the district, in its various branches of geology,
mineralogy, zoology, and botany, by the gradual formation of
complete and systematic arrangements of its productions, in each
of these departments.&nbsp; It is also open <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>to other
objects of scientific interest, and in particular is a suitable
repository for such remains of antiquity as are found within the
district, or illustrate its general history.&nbsp; But, in
addition to these more local objects, the museum will, it is
anticipated, through the liberality of the friends of science in
various quarters, be enriched with many specimens from distant
places.</p>
<p>The library consists of Books illustrative of Natural History
and Antiquities, and such works of reference as the funds of the
society may admit of being purchased, for the illustration of the
objects in the museum.&nbsp; The library, as well as the museum,
is open to donations from the members and friends of the
institution.</p>
<p>The society&rsquo;s affairs are under the management of a
council, consisting of a president and other officers, elected
annually.</p>
<p>A house situated in Dogpole is at present the temporary
repository for the collections of the Museum, &amp;c.</p>
<h3>THE SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY</h3>
<p>Is on St. John&rsquo;s Hill, and contains an excellent
collection of books in the various departments of literature and
science.&nbsp; Its affairs are confided to a committee.&nbsp;
Proprietary members pay two guineas admission, and an annual
subscription of one guinea and a half; and strangers, on the
introduction of a subscriber, have the privilege of consulting
any of the books during library hours.</p>
<h3>THE NEW CHORAL SOCIETY</h3>
<p>Has for its design the cultivation of the delightful science
of sacred music, and was revived in 1834.&nbsp; It is under the
management of a secretary and committee, and is supported by a
respectable number of honorary members.</p>
<h3><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>THE
HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY</h3>
<p>was engrafted (in the year 1834) on a florists&rsquo; society
planted in this town in 1823.&nbsp; Its object is to promote the
culture of the auricula, polyanthus, pink, ranunculus, carnation,
picotee, dahlia, gooseberry, &amp;c.</p>
<h3>MECHANICS&rsquo; INSTITUTION.</h3>
<p>This institution commenced in 1825, and in the year 1833 a
building was erected for their meetings in Howard-street,
Castle-foregate.&nbsp; The expences of the establishment are
defrayed by subscriptions and donations.</p>
<h3>NEWSPAPERS.</h3>
<p>Two weekly newspapers are published here: viz.
<i>Wednesday</i>, <span class="smcap">The Salopian
Journal</span>, by Mr. John Eddowes, Corn-market.&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<h3>SHREWSBURY QUARRY.</h3>
<p>On the south-western side of the town is one of the most
celebrated promenades in the kingdom, called The Quarry.</p>
<p>It is formed in a tract of verdant meadow ground of
twenty-three acres, gradually sloping to the river Severn, along
the banks of which are planted a graceful avenue of lime trees,
extending 540 yards in length, whose lofty arching branches
entwine themselves so as to resemble the long aisle of some
religious fane.</p>
<p>Three other walks, planted in a similar manner, serve as
approaches from the town to this the principal promenade, which
being enlivened with many pleasing views, renders it in point of
situation and beauty unrivalled.</p>
<p>Here the inhabitant may inhale the refreshing breeze wafted
from the rippling river,&mdash;the invalid find a cool and
sequestered retreat free from the noise of a bustling
town,&mdash;while the mind alive to the charms of nature may
enjoy its philosophic contemplations in the ever-changing
beauties of the seasons.</p>
<p>A cluster of horse-chesnut and other trees growing in a
dingle, and which in autumn present a beautifully variegated <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>mass of
foliage, diversify what otherwise might be considered a formal
arrangement of these walks, which were planted during the
mayoralty of Henry Jenks, Esq. in 1719, and derive their name
from a red sandstone which was formerly procured from this
dingle.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the meandering river is a verdant
eminence fringed with luxuriant plantations.</p>
<p>At the north-western end of the Quarry, near Claremont, is a
sloping bank, which originally formed an amphitheatre, called the
&ldquo;Dry Dingle,&rdquo; where religious mysteries (or miracle
plays) were celebrated.&nbsp; Prince Arthur, in 1494, attended
one of these exhibitions, which were performed on this spot, even
after the Reformation, by the head-schoolmaster, Mr. Ashton, and
his pupils.</p>
<p>Crossing the ferry, at the extremity of the walk leading from
the remains of this amphitheatre, and pursuing the footpath in
the field to the left of the Boat-house, we reach an eminence
from whence a prospect opens to the view combining water, hill,
plain, and wood in charming variety.&nbsp; Continuing from hence
to the right of the House of Industry, we arrive at</p>
<h3>KINGSLAND,</h3>
<p>or, as written in an early Norman grant,
<i>Chingsland</i>.&nbsp; This is an extensive piece of land,
belonging to the ancient burgesses of Shrewsbury, thirty of whom
in rotation annually receive four shillings and sixpence from its
produce, in lieu of a &ldquo;turn for their kine.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
this place the festival of Shrewsbury Show (described page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page109">109</a></span>) is held,
and it commands a prospect which stretches to a considerable
distance over a beautiful and well-cultivated country,
diversified with mountains possessing form and interest.</p>
<p>Returning to the front of the House of Industry, and <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>pursuing
the path from the bank on which that building stands, we cross
the Severn by means of the ferry at the Can Office, and enter the
pastures called &ldquo;<i>Stury&rsquo;s Close</i>&rdquo; where
the Earl of Pembroke, Lord President of the Marches,
&ldquo;mustered all the country, both of horsemen and
footmen,&rdquo; in 1588 (a year memorable for the defeat of the
Invincible Armada), and soon reach</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>The
remnant illustrated by the wood cut comprises probably the
refectory, which was partly re-edificed as late as the reign of
Henry the Eighth.</p>
<p>This religious society, sometimes called Friars Minors,
settled in this town early in the thirteenth century.&nbsp;
Hawis, wife to Charleton Lord of Powys (born in 1291), and heir
of the ancient Princes of Powys Gwenwynwyn, was a great
benefactress to this friary, if not its second foundress.</p>
<p>From the quantity of bones which have been found within the
precinct of this convent, it would seem that no unprofitable use
was made of the privilege granted to this order by the Pope of
&ldquo;<i>liberam sepulturam</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This and their
reputed sanctity, as well as the popular belief that whoever was
buried in their cemetery or in the habit of a grey friar would be
secure from the attacks of evil spirits and find an easy entrance
into heaven, were circumstances doubtless of such importance as
to induce many persons to desire sepulture among such hallowed
men.</p>
<p>The splendid stained glass now in the eastern window of St.
Mary&rsquo;s chancel is supposed to have originally decorated the
church of this friary, which was the burial place of the Lords of
Powys.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the river is the foundry and the
suburb of Coleham.</p>
<p>Passing under the arch of the English Bridge, to the left are
some modern dwellings on the site of a curious half-timbered
mansion erected in the reign of Elizabeth by William Jones, an
alderman and opulent draper of the town, and father of Thomas
Jones, the first mayor of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; A view and
description of this curious building, communicated by the author
of these pages, will be found in vol. 99, part ii. of the
Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine.</p>
<p>A few yards beyond stood</p>
<h3><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>THE
DOMINICAN FRIARY,</h3>
<p>which comprehended nearly the whole space now occupied by
gardens between the bridge and the water gate. <a
name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"
class="citation">[176]</a></p>
<p>This order of mendicants took their name from their founder,
and were sometimes called &ldquo;Preachers&rdquo; from their
office, and &ldquo;Black Friars&rdquo; from their dress.</p>
<p>The convent, like those of the Austin and Franciscan friars,
was placed on the margin of the river, outside the walls and
adjacent to the bridges.</p>
<p>From the rich architectural remains, &amp;c. which have
occasionally been dug up here, the church must have been a
spacious and elegant building; but, in common with the other
convents, it shared the fate of the dissolution of monasteries,
and was sold by Henry the Eighth in 1543.&nbsp; The hand of man,
combined with the operations of time, had, previously to 1823,
left but few vestiges either of the convent where Richard and
George Plantagenet, two sons of Edward the Fourth, were born, or
the more recent fortifications erected on this interesting
spot,&mdash;where several military transactions were determined
in various periods of our domestic history.</p>
<p>The bank on which this friary stood was levelled in the
above-mentioned year, when the foundations of several walls were
cleared to a considerable extent, and numerous capitals, pieces
of mullions, with remains of stained glass, enamelled tiles,
&amp;c. were discovered by the workmen employed in the
construction of a new building and wharf.&nbsp; Several stone
graves were also brought to view, the masonry of which was well
finished, and formed so as nearly to fit the corpse.&nbsp; After
clearing the soil from these tombs, skeletons <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>were found
encased in red sand, but without the least trace of any thing in
which the body might have been enveloped.&nbsp; The only remains
of this once noble pile are the materials used in the
construction of a stable and the wall surrounding the
gardens.&nbsp; Adjoining is</p>
<h3>THE WATER-LANE GATE,</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Through which the parliamentary army entered, Feb. 22d,
1644&ndash;5, and captured the town.&nbsp; The means by which
this was accomplished showed much generalship and secrecy on <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>the part of
the Parliamentarians.&nbsp; It appears a detachment of soldiers
belonging to that party left Wem, and marched under the shadow of
night to the extremity of the Castle-foregate, where the troopers
halted at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, in order that the
foot soldiers might effect an entrance by stratagem.&nbsp; The
infantry turned off on the left to the river, being led by a
puritanical minister of the town, named Huson, a kinsman of the
celebrated John Huson, who from a cobbler rose to be a colonel
and a member of the Barebones parliament.</p>
<p>The dismounted troopers were under the command of Benbow, who,
being a native of Shrewsbury, was aware of the part most easily
attacked.&nbsp; From the end of Castle-foregate they advanced
through the fields to the castle ditch (now a thoroughfare),
which was defended on the town side by strong palisading and a
breastwork of earth.&nbsp; A boat on the river contained several
carpenters and other persons, who commenced sawing down the
paling near the river to effect a passage for the soldiers.&nbsp;
This was soon accomplished, and by assisting one another over the
ditch the breastwork was gained.&nbsp; Having succeeded thus far,
they seem to have divided themselves into two divisions; the one
party, headed by Benbow, scaled the wall on the eminence between
the Watch Tower and the Council House, by means of light
ladders.&nbsp; The main body, consisting of 350 men, entered by
the gate shewn in the engraving, to which a tower and outwork was
formerly attached.&nbsp; This, and a similar fort about the
middle of the lane where the town wall crossed, yielded without
resistance by the connivance of careless and treacherous
sentinels, who are supposed to have been intoxicated and privy to
the design.&nbsp; The party who had scaled the wall hastened to
procure an entrance at the north or castle gate, which was soon
done, and having let down the draw-bridge, the horse, with <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>Colonels
Mytton and Bowyer at their head, made the best of their way to
the main court of guard held in the Market-place, where they
found their comrades engaged with the royalists.&nbsp; The loss
on both sides was inconsiderable, amounting to only seven men and
one captain.&nbsp; The castle surrendered about noon, when the
garrison was immediately marched off to Ludlow, with the
exception of thirteen poor Irishmen, who, being left to the
tender mercies of the parliamentary leaders, were hanged the same
day without trial.</p>
<p>Continuing the walk by the side of the river, the most
prominent object is the tower on the castle mount, from whose
lofty height a group of majestic trees decline to the banks of
the Severn, which in this part bends gracefully over its gravelly
bed.&nbsp; The pathway brings us to the island where a pageant
took place in honour of Sir Henry Sidney (noticed page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page11">11</a></span>).&nbsp; A
little beyond, on the opposite side of the river, is the ferry
for conveying horses across by which barges are towed up the
stream. <a name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179"
class="citation">[179]</a>&nbsp; The meadows into which we have
passed comprised a portion of the ancient Derfald, or enclosure
for the keeping of deer,&mdash;in other words a park, which may
not inaptly be called</p>
<h3>SHREWSBURY PARK,</h3>
<p>for it belonged to our first Norman earl, and in all
probability to some of the Saxon monarchs.&nbsp; The situation of
the ground, before it was stripped of its timber, possessed every
advantage of pasture, water, and diversified
surface.&mdash;According to the record of Domesday, it was the
custom, when the king resided here, for twelve of the better sort
of citizens to keep watch over him; and when he went out hunting,
those having horses protected him.&nbsp; This practice <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>probably
arose in consequence of the murder of Alfhelm (an earl of the
blood royal) in 1016, who, having been invited here and
hospitably entertained by &AElig;dric Streona (son-in-law to King
Etheldred), was barbarously assassinated by a butcher while
hunting, whom the perfidious &AElig;dric had engaged for that
purpose.</p>
<p>The boundaries of these pleasant fields bring us to the
Shrewsbury canal, which for some distance beyond passes above the
banks of the river; while from the canal towing-path numerous
pleasing views may be obtained, affording an agreeable
half-hour&rsquo;s walk to the picturesque village of
Uffington.</p>
<p>Retracing our steps along the green banks of the Severn, we
arrive at a gentle ascent which leads to the promenade
surrounding the prison.&nbsp; From hence the long ridge of
Haughmond Hill, linked as it were to the noble Wrekin,&mdash;the
stately character of the White Hall,&mdash;the patriotic Column
in honour of Lord Hill,&mdash;the venerable Abbey Church,
standing like a patriarch among its more modern
compeers,&mdash;the Stretton Hills in the distance, and close at
hand the frowning walls of the Castle, clad by nature&rsquo;s
hand with stains of sober hue, combine to attract the eye and the
mind.</p>
<p>On a line with the front of the County Prison is</p>
<h3>HOWARD-STREET,</h3>
<p>having at the top a fine colossal figure of Hercules, which
was cast at Rome from the Farnese Hercules, and is no inapt
memorial of the labour consequent upon the removal of upwards of
26,000 loads of soil in the formation of the street.</p>
<p>Passing to the <span class="smcap">Dana Walk</span>,
&ldquo;where the huge castle hold its state,&rdquo; the prospect
is bounded to the right by the eminences of Hawkstone, Grinshill,
Pimhill, Almond Park, <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>and the plain of
&ldquo;Battlefield.&rdquo;&nbsp; Westward is Berwick House,
embosomed in sylvan beauty, and beyond in the horizon are a range
of Cambrian mountains, gradually fading into the clouds, which in
point of colour they not unfrequently resemble.&nbsp; Among these
may be particularly distinguished those gigantic landmarks
between England and Wales,&mdash;the Breidden and Moelygolfa
hills.&nbsp; The former rises to the height of 1000 feet, and has
on the summit a pillar erected to commemorate the great victory
obtained by Admiral Rodney over the French fleet in the West
Indies, 1782.</p>
<p>By a modern archway opened through the wall abutting from the
Castle at the time this walk was formed, in 1790, we are again
brought within the walls.&nbsp; This part, however, of</p>
<h3>THE TOWN WALLS</h3>
<p>extended in a line with the Castle Gates across the isthmus
down to the banks of the river, having a corresponding barrier on
the other side of the castle.&nbsp; It was erected by Robert de
Belesme, third Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, under the idea that his
father&rsquo;s fortifications were not of sufficient strength to
withstand a siege from the forces of Henry I. which in 1102
marched against him (page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page14">14</a></span>).</p>
<p>An additional rampart called Roushill, enclosing the space
between the wall of Earl Robert and the Welsh bridge, was added
during the Commonwealth.&nbsp; These walls for many years served
as a communication between the northern and western parts of the
town; but in 1835 the more modern portion was nearly buried in
the formation of a new road.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The old building used for the purpose of dramatic performance
in this town, is said to have formed part of a royal dwelling of
the Princes of Powys Land.&nbsp; Having long been ruinous, it was
purchased by Mr. Bennett, the manager, and taken down in
1833.&nbsp; The erection of the present theatre on its site has
been an important improvement to the thoroughfare leading to St.
John&rsquo;s Hill and the Quarry, as well as an ornament to the
town.&nbsp; It forms a centre and two wings; the lower part
consists of a rusticated base, upwards of 100 feet in length,
fitted up as shops, with a house for the manager.&nbsp; Above is
a continued string-course, from which rises two pilasters in each
wing, supporting a frieze and cornice.</p>
<p>The windows are finished with architraves, and the front of
the building displays three niches, containing statues of the
immortal bard <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> and of the
<span class="smcap">Comic</span> and <span class="smcap">Tragic
Muse</span>, executed in compos by Mr. James Parry, a native of
this town.</p>
<p>The interior of the theatre is conveniently arranged: in the
centre is a dome, and the ceiling richly decorated with
appropriate devices.&nbsp; The building is creditable to the
taste of Mr. Bennett, whose spirited undertaking in this public
improvement will no doubt be appreciated by the lovers of the
drama.&nbsp; The new structure was opened Sept. 8th, 1834, under
the patronage of the Mayor.</p>
<h3>THE CIRCUS</h3>
<p>is a large brick building near the Welsh bridge, in which <a

<h3>THE HORSE RACES</h3>
<p>are annually held in the third week of September, and continue
for three days.&nbsp; They are generally attended by the rank and
fashion of the county, and attract a considerable influx of
visitors to the town.&nbsp; The king contributes a plate of one
hundred guineas.</p>
<h3>THE ASSEMBLY ROOM</h3>
<p>was erected in 1777, at the back of the Lion Hotel, and is a
commodious and tastefully decorated apartment, where most of the
balls are held.</p>
<h3>THE SHREWSBURY HUNT</h3>
<p>takes place about the middle of November, and brings to the
town a respectable number of the nobility and gentry of the
county, who pass a week with a president annually chosen from the
members, while a fashionable ball gives additional hilarity to
the meeting.</p>
<h3>ANGLING.</h3>
<p>The Severn has long been celebrated for the excellency of its
fish&mdash;salmon, pike, grayling, trout, perch, and many
others.&nbsp; The votaries of the &ldquo;Gentle Craft,&rdquo; if
not always gratified with excellent sport, or the finny tribe
should sometimes not be disposed &ldquo;to bite,&rdquo; may find
pleasure in the contemplation of the scenery around.</p>
<p>It must however be mentioned, and with regret, that the
fishing of the river near the town has of late years been almost
ruined by the daring excess of poaching with illegal nets, so as
to threaten, as it were, the annihilation of the piscatory race,
unless the laws are put in force for their <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>defence.&nbsp; Some of the lesser streams near the
town, however, afford a tolerable supply of good trout.</p>
<h3>AQUATIC EXCURSIONS.</h3>
<p>Much pleasant exercise and amusement is afforded on the Severn
during the summer months.&nbsp; Several parties possess boats,
and an emulation of skill is frequently excited among the more
experienced rowers.</p>
<p>An annual gala is generally given by the young gentlemen of
Shrewsbury School in the month of June.</p>
<p>Boats may be hired for the day at a moderate charge, and
pic-nic parties take an excursion up the river to the picturesque
and woody banks at Shelton, the shady groves near Berwick and the
Isle, or downwards to the rural villages of Uffington, Atcham,
&amp;c.&nbsp; On a summer&rsquo;s evening, when all is calm and
serene, the sail is truly delightful.</p>
<h3>THE SUBURBS OF SHREWSBURY</h3>
<p>comprise five separate districts, viz. Coton Hill, Castle
Foregate, Frankwell, Abbey Foregate, and Coleham, containing a
population equal to that within the walls.</p>
<p>In noticing these, it is purposed to commence where our walk
terminated without the walls, viz. the Castle Gates, from whence
the Castle Foregate and Coton Hill diverge.&nbsp; Taking the
latter thoroughfare, to the left we enter Chester Street, into
which a new line of road is opened, communicating with Mardol,
and carried over the ancient fosse and through a portion of the
wall erected by Robert de Belesme.&nbsp; A few yards further
are</p>
<h3>THE WATER WORKS,</h3>
<p>which supply every house in the remotest part of the town with
water for domestic purposes, being raised from the <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>river by
means of a steam engine, capable of throwing up 22,000 gallons in
the hour.&nbsp; The Company was established under an act of
parliament in 1830. <a name="citation186"></a><a
href="#footnote186" class="citation">[186]</a></p>
<p>Nearly opposite are</p>
<h3>THE ROYAL BATHS,</h3>

187</span>affording conveniences equal to any which are to be
found in the first-rate establishments of this kind in the
kingdom, while the moderate terms and strict attention to
cleanliness and comfort will, no doubt, ensure to them the
patronage and support of the public.&nbsp; Hot air, vapour,
shower, warm, salt, medicated, and fresh water baths are in
constant readiness, and the pleasure bath is of sufficient
dimensions to enable persons to learn the art of swimming.</p>
<p>The building is of a chaste design, the front being ornamented
with a portico, supported by two Ionic pillars and two
pilasters.</p>
<p>From the road, winding on the banks of the river, an imposing
view of the town may be obtained, with a considerable portion of
the walls by which it was formerly encompassed.&nbsp; A bold
clump of trees on the right denotes</p>
<h3>BENBOW HOUSE,</h3>
<p>where the gallant Admiral Benbow was born in 1650, whose
distinguished deeds in arms have rendered him an honour to our
town and country.&nbsp; This brave sailor not only stood against
the enemy in the memorable action off Carthagena, in August,
1702, until every hold was gone, but had to encounter the
unparalleled treachery of those under his command.&nbsp; The
operation of amputating his leg, which was shattered by a
chain-shot in the late engagement, added to the deep mental
anxiety occasioned by the base conduct of his captains, brought
on a fever which terminated his career of glory November 4th, in
the same year, universally lamented.&nbsp; His remains received
the rites of sepulture in Kingston church, Jamaica. <a
name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a></p>
<p>In the year 1828, a subscription was commenced in this town
for the purpose of erecting some memorial in <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>St.
Mary&rsquo;s church (the parish in which he was born)
commemorative of this distinguished Salopian, towards which our
no less courageous townsman, Admiral Sir Edward Owen, K.C.B. with
that frankness and honourable feeling so characteristic of the
true British sailor, munificently contributed.</p>
<p>We now arrive at</p>
<h3>COTON HILL,</h3>
<p>where stood the suburban mansion of the Myttons of Halston, in
which that family resided after vacating their town house of
Vaughan&rsquo;s Place.&nbsp; North-west of the turnpike was</p>
<h3>ST. CATHARINE&rsquo;s CHAPEL,</h3>
<p>in a pasture still called the Chapel Yard. <a
name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188"
class="citation">[188]</a></p>
<p>Coton appears at a remote period to have been connected with
the Suburb of Frankwell by a bank, which caused the river to
spread over the meadows called the &ldquo;Purditches,&rdquo;
forcing its waters from thence under Hencot and Cross Hill in a
channel still strongly marked by its rising banks, and
discernible at all times, especially during floods, until the
stream found its way into the present channel near the Royal
Baths.&nbsp; This is particularly evident at the foot of Cross
Hill, one mile on the Ellesmere road, to the right of which a
toll bar communicates with a pleasant lane, the ancient road to
Berwick.&nbsp; From the brow of this lane, the old course of the
Severn may be easily defined.&nbsp; From hence, also, the town
unfolds itself with peculiar beauty backed by the frontier of
Salopian and Cambrian <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>mountains, increasing in variety and
picturesque effect throughout this delightful rural walk, until
we arrive at Marshall&rsquo;s Factory, where a wooden bridge over
the canal conducts again to the suburb of</p>
<h3>THE CASTLE FOREGATE,</h3>
<p>the point from which we at first diverged.&nbsp; This long
street has become a place of much traffic, owing to a
communication having been opened, in 1835, with Birmingham,
London, Liverpool, &amp;c. by means of <span class="smcap">The
Shrewsbury Canal</span>, to and from which places goods are
received into warehouses erected on its banks.&nbsp; This canal
was originally formed in 1797, for the purpose of supplying the
town and neighbourhood with coal, brought from Hadley, Ketley,
&amp;c. in the eastern part of Shropshire.</p>
<p>The canal terminates on the N.W. side of the County Prison, in
a spacious</p>
<h3>COAL WHARF,</h3>
<p>belonging to the Canal Company, where this indispensible
necessary of life may be obtained, of excellent quality, at
fifteen shillings per ton.&nbsp; Coal is also procured at the
collieries of Welbatch and Uffington, three miles distant from
the town.</p>
<h3>THE SUBURB OF FRANKWELL,</h3>
<p>anciently written <i>Frankville</i>, lies on the west side of
the Welsh bridge, and is a township within the parish of St.
Chad.&nbsp; In former times it suffered much from the ravages of
the Welsh, being in the line of road to the principality, as it
is now the thoroughfare to Holyhead.</p>
<p>The inquisitive eye of the antiquary will discover in this
suburb many curious specimens of the half-timbered dwellings of
our ancestors, one in particular, better known now as the
&ldquo;String of Horses,&rdquo; appears, from initials, &amp;c.
<a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>over the
chimney piece, to have been erected at least as early as
1576.&nbsp; To the left of this building is &ldquo;New
Street,&rdquo; leading to Millington&rsquo;s Hospital, Kingsland,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Roads also branch off to the village of Hanwood,
and the mining districts of Pontesbury and Westbury.</p>
<p>Passing onward to the right is St. George&rsquo;s church (page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page89">89</a></span>), a
short distance from which is the &ldquo;Mount,&rdquo; so called
from a strong outwork erected during the civil wars, under the
direction of Lord Capel, and in which he planted several pieces
of cannon to protect the town.&nbsp; The garrison of this fort
vigorously resisted the attacks of the parliamentarians, even
after the town and castle had been captured.&nbsp; In the
evening, however, of that day, they had no other alternative but
to surrender upon bare quarter.</p>
<p>Near this fortification stood a religious house called Cadogan
Chapel, which, in the third year of Edward VI. passed into lay
hands.&nbsp; In 1604 it was remaining, though in a ruinous state,
having been appropriated in that year as the &ldquo;Pest
House.&rdquo; <a name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a></p>
<p>The precinct of this chapel probably extended as far as
Millington&rsquo;s Hospital, the site of the latter being to this
day called &ldquo;The Chapel Yard,&rdquo; and in the gardens
adjoining it skeletons have been found, while a strong yew-tree
hedge, still visible at the western end of Cadogan Place, was no
doubt its boundary in that direction, near which spot stood
&ldquo;<i>Cadogan&rsquo;s Cross</i>,&rdquo; where sermons in
other days were occasionally delivered.&nbsp; The bailiffs&rsquo;
accounts, for 1542, record the item of sixpence for wine given to
the Lord President&rsquo;s chaplain, preaching at Cadogan&rsquo;s
Cross on the Rogation day.&nbsp; <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>The meadows below (on the banks of
the Severn), called &ldquo;<i>Monks Eye</i>,&rdquo; were granted
by Reginald Pinzun to the &ldquo;Almonry&rdquo; of Shrewsbury
Abbey, in the reign of Henry III. previously to which they bore
the appellation of &ldquo;<i>Crosfurlong</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Extending our walk for one mile on the great Holyhead road
(with the fine woods of Berwick on the opposite side of the
river) we reach the township of <span
class="smcap">Shelton</span>, where are some neat suburban villas
which unite architectural taste and rural decoration with beauty
of situation and commanding prospects.&nbsp; At this place
stands</p>
<h3>GLENDOWER&rsquo;S OAK,</h3>
<p>famed from the tradition that Owen Glendower, in 1403,
ascended its branches to ascertain the event of the Battle of
Shrewsbury, a circumstance not unlikely when it is considered
that the country was probably more open at that time than at
present.</p>
<p>This champion of Welsh independence, it has been already
shown, assembled his forces at Oswestry, from whence, according
to Holinshed, he sent off only his first division, consisting of
4000 men, who behaved with spirit in the day of action.&nbsp; The
Welsh historians, however, have censured his conduct on this
occasion, and blame him for what it appears from some cause he
was unable to effect, viz. in neglecting to attack Henry after
the battle, when the royal forces had sustained a severe loss and
were overcome with fatigue, and when his own followers and the
remainder of the northern troops would have formed an army nearly
double that of the king&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There are documents to prove that this oak was &ldquo;<i>a
great tree</i>&rdquo; within 140 years after the Battle of
Shrewsbury, and was an object of remark to old people long
before.&nbsp; It is now a chronicle to the eye of the passing
traveller, and <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>to those who delight to be carried back into the depth
of antiquity.&nbsp; Long may it be preserved from injury, and
viewed as the natural historical monument of our vicinity; for
Time has truly</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hollowed
in its trunk<br />
A tomb for centuries; and buried there<br />
The epochs of the rise and fall of states,<br />
The fading generations of the world,<br />
The memory of man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to a recent measurement, the tree is 41&frac12; feet
in height; the girth at the base is 44&frac14; feet, and at eight
feet from the ground 27&frac14; feet.</p>
<p>The interior is hollow, consisting of little more than a shell
of bark, forming an alcove capable of holding a dozen
individuals; and notwithstanding the branches of this aged tree
have borne the blast of many a wintry storm, still it may be
said&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Spring<br />
Finds thee not less alive to her sweet force<br />
Than the young upstarts of the neighbouring woods,<br />
So much thy juniors, who their birth received<br />
Half a millennium since the date of thine.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>THE ABBEY FOREGATE.</h3>
<p>Passing over the English, or east bridge, from which there is
a striking prospect of the town and the tower on the Castle
Mount, we reach a small tract of ground, comprising a few houses,
called</p>
<h3>MERIVALE,</h3>
<p>or, <i>Murivale</i>, probably from its connexion with the
walls.</p>
<p>In reference to this it appears that in the early part of the
13th century, the abbot consented that the two plats of ground
between the main road at the east end of the bridge should be
left void for the purpose of erecting defences in <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>the time of
war; hence Merivale subsequently became matter of frequent
contest between the Corporation and the Abbey, as to the right of
jurisdiction within it.&nbsp; This was not finally settled until
the dissolution of the monastery, when Henry VIII. stating the
&ldquo;intimate affection&rdquo; which he bears towards the town
of Salop, and his desire &ldquo;to do and shew favour to the
bailiffs and burgesses,&rdquo; grants that they and their
successors may for ever enjoy all the liberties, privileges,
&amp;c. within the limits of the Abbey Foregate, including the
hamlet of Merivale, in as ample manner as they were enjoyed by
the last abbot or his predecessors.</p>
<p>Leaving the National School to the right,</p>
<h3>THE MONASTIC REMAINS</h3>
<p>next claim our notice, and although now very inconsiderable,
yet, like most other Abbeys, they originally consisted chiefly of
two quadrangular courts of different dimensions, the conventual
church, as was customary, being towards the north.&nbsp; Situated
on the other sides were the refectory, almonry, chapter house,
dormitory, locutory or parlour, infirmary, guest hall or
hospitium, kitchen, and other domestic offices.&nbsp; The
abbot&rsquo;s house or lodging commonly formed one or more
portions of the smaller quadrangle, and consisted of a complete
mansion.</p>
<p>This Abbey, bereft of its endowments by the reforming spirit
of Henry VIII. shared the fate of other similar foundations in
the rapine of the dissolution; the buildings connected therewith
were sold, and soon afterwards despoiled of their constituent
parts, chiefly for the value of the materials, while portions
were converted into dwellings and other purposes, or left quietly
to moulder into decay.</p>
<p>Of the remains which have excited most attention is an elegant
octagonal</p>
<h3><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>STONE PULPIT,</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p194b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>from which one of the junior monks was accustomed to read to
his brethren while seated at their meals.&nbsp; Its situation,
one half resting on the ruined wall of the Refectory,
indisputably proves this; looking outward of the site of that
building it forms a small bay window, while the other portion,
once inside the hall, is supported on a moulded bracket, which
springs from a corbel originally carved as a head.&nbsp; From
hence it projects to the basement of the floor, twelve feet from
which rises a conical roof sustained on six narrow pointed
arches, having trefoil heads.</p>
<p>The interior forms a beautiful oriel, the roof being vaulted
on eight delicate ribs, at the intersection of which in the
centre is a boss of comparatively large dimensions; on this is
beautifully sculptured The Crucifixion, with St. <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>John and
the Virgin Mary at the foot of the cross, enclosed under a
trefoil arch flanked by buttresses.&nbsp; The spaces of the three
northern arches, looking inwards, are filled with embattled stone
panels about three feet high, on which are enshrined several
figures of saints, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This interesting relic is approached from the garden by a
flight of steps through a small doorway worked originally, it is
considered, within the thickness of the wall of the
refectory.</p>
<p>The south wing of what is supposed to have been part of the
monk&rsquo;s infirmary, chapel, &amp;c. remains south-west of the
church.&nbsp; It is now appropriated as a malthouse, and may be
distinguished by its lofty gables.&nbsp; A similar building
converted into dwellings stood near the street, and was connected
with the above by an embattled ruin flanked by massive piers,
between which were square windows divided by a transom.&nbsp;
This was an imposing feature to our monastic remains, and truly
venerable from its antiquity, having braved the storms and
tempests of nearly one thousand years, but was taken down without
a feeling of forbearance in 1836, and the materials applied for
the foundations of two houses adjoining its site.</p>
<p>The present Abbey house is supposed to have been the guest
hall, or hospitium, to the east of which three pointed arches,
once forming part of a groined ceiling, denote the abbot&rsquo;s
lodging.</p>
<p>Of the chapter house, where the members of the monastery
assembled to transact their official business, not a relic is
left; but in excavating near its site, in 1836, a leaden seal was
found, which had been once appended to a bull from the Pope,
whose name is thus inscribed on it, INNOCENTIVS. PP. IIII.</p>
<p>The monks of this Abbey, in the third year of Pope <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>Innocent
IV. i.e. 1246, obtained a bull, setting forth the injuries
committed against their lands, tithes, possessions, &amp;c. by
the monastery of Lilleshull, by which the dean and precentor of
Lichfield were directed to convoke the parties and hear the
cause.</p>
<p>The dormitory was attached to the south-west side of the
church, and was cut through in the formation of a new line of
road in 1836.</p>
<p>What a train of reflections, loudly bespeaking the
vicissitudes of life, may be called forth during our walk along
this new thoroughfare.&nbsp; Who is there, it may be asked, with
a mind to think and a heart to feel, that can thoughtlessly pass
over ground which has been distinguished in history, without a
momentary reflection upon its former importance?</p>
<p>Within the Chapter House, which stood on a portion of this
road, occurred the earliest authorized assembly of that popular
representation in the constitution of this kingdom, to which,
under Providence, Englishmen have been indebted for all their
subsequent prosperity,&mdash;all their energies, and that noble
independence which have characterized us as a people among
nations. <a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a></p>
<p>Here, too, Richard the Second gratified his fondness for
magnificence, by entertaining the members of his parliament with
a sumptuous feast, and, as if to dazzle by the splendour of
monarchy, and to awe by military display, he was attired in his
royal robes, and attended by a numerous guard of Cheshire
men.</p>
<p>The fervent orisons of a grateful heart have here been
uplifted&mdash;divinity and other important subjects
discussed&mdash;and on this spot the nobility, gentry, abbots,
priors, deans, &amp;c. of Shropshire, have frequently
congregated, and banished for a time the gloomy silence and sable
garb of the brotherhood, <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>and exchanged the sober gravity of
the refectory, and its austere monkish repast, for wine and
wassail, minstrelsey and song.</p>
<p>Before quitting these scattered ruins, the present remains of
the Abbey church must excite feelings of regret in the breast of
every admirer of our ancient architecture, at the mistaken zeal
which caused its partial and barbarous demolition.</p>
<p>An embattled wall encompassed the northern and eastern sides
of the precinct, beyond which is the <span
class="smcap">Foregate</span>, a respectable open street, nearly
one mile in length, and chiefly occupied by private
residences.&nbsp; The houses to the south have gardens which
extend to the Reabrook, and command delightful prospects of the
adjacent country.&nbsp; This suburb (April 1st, 1774) suffered
considerably from a fire, which destroyed 47 dwellings, 16 barns,
15 stables, 4 shops, and several stacks of hay, beside damaging
other property.</p>
<p>On the left, half way up the street, is</p>
<h3>THE WHITE HALL,</h3>
<p>So called from a practice, during the last century, of
occasionally colouring its deep red walls.&nbsp; Our native poet
(Churchyard) speaks of this stone mansion in his usual quaint
manner, as standing &ldquo;so trim and finely that it graceth all
the soil it is in.&rdquo;&nbsp; In front is a handsome gatehouse;
and the pointed gables, central cupola, and ornamental chimnies,
strongly characterise it as an interesting specimen of the old
English residence peculiar to the reign of Elizabeth, while its
sombre appearance is finely set forth by the vivid foliage of
walnut and other trees adjoining.&nbsp; The interior has been
modernised, and forms a comfortable habitation.&nbsp; The
building was commenced in 1578 by <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>Richard Prince, Esq. a celebrated
lawyer, and was his manorial residence.&nbsp; It now belongs to
the Right Rev. the Bishop of Lichfield, by purchase from Earl
Tankerville.</p>

<p>A few yards distant is</p>
<h3>THE RACE GROUND,</h3>
<p>called the &ldquo;Soldier&rsquo;s Piece,&rdquo; from the
circumstance of Charles the First having drawn up his army here
(page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page11">11</a></span>).</p>
<p>Situated within a very few minutes&rsquo; walk of the town, <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>it may in
most points compete with all the secondary courses in the
kingdom.&nbsp; It is one mile and 185 yards in circumference, and
in addition to a fine straight run for coming-in of 500 yards,
possesses the advantage of a sight of the horses throughout the
race, combined with an extensive panoramic view of the adjacent
richly diversified country; while the town, from so many points
picturesque, has from hence a most pleasing appearance.</p>
<p>It may be remarked that this race course is formed on a plan,
it is believed, not previously adopted, the arrangement being
such as to provide for any distance, from half a mile to four
miles, the different lengths being conveniently fixed and marked
with letters on short posts inside the course; a reference to
which is placed in the winning chair for the information of the
public.</p>
<p>A footpath through the meadows near the Hall conducts to the
east end of Abbey-foregate, and the noble Column erected on the
great London road in commemoration of the military achievements
of Lord Hill, who, on his return to his native county, in 1814,
was welcomed into Shrewsbury by his countrymen with all the
splendid honours attendant upon a triumphal hero.&nbsp; The most
enthusiastic rejoicings took place, and upwards of 20,000 persons
assembled to witness the festivities, &amp;c. provided on the
occasion in the Quarry.</p>
<p>Leaving the venerable church of St. Giles to the left, and
proceeding about one mile to the right, along a pleasant walk
embellished throughout by an interesting prospect, we reach the
saline and chalybeate spring called</p>
<h3>SUTTON SPA,</h3>
<p>situated in a retired dell near the margin of the Reabrook,
and the property of the Right Hon. Lord Berwick.</p>
<p>The spring issues from a rocky stratum of ash-coloured <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>clay, or
argillaceous schistus.&nbsp; The water is colourless, and exhales
a faint sulphureous smell, much more perceptible in rainy
weather.&nbsp; It has been compared with the Cheltenham water,
but in reality bears a stronger affinity to sea water,
possessing, however, an advantage over that in containing
iron.&nbsp; In those cases, therefore, for which sea water is
usually recommended it has been found most beneficial, and proves
highly serviceable in the treatment of glandular affections,
scrofula, and other diseases of the skin.&nbsp; A tumbler
glassful operates as a brisk aperient.</p>
<p>The following analysis of the water was recently read at one
of the scientific meetings of the Shropshire Natural History
Society:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Eleven cubic inches of the water contain about
half a cubic inch of carbonic acid, partly free and partly in a
combined state, a quarter of a cubic inch of atmospheric air, and
a trace of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>
<p>Sixteen fluid ounces contain of&mdash;</p>
<p>Iodine and bromine, each a trace</p>
<p>Carbonate iron, about 0.7 grain</p>
<p>&mdash; lime and siliceous earth, each a trace</p>
<p>Anhydrous muriate magnesia, 8.8 grains</p>
<p>&mdash; &mdash; lime, 30 grains</p>
<p>&mdash; &mdash; soda, 121.3 grains. <a
name="citation200"></a><a href="#footnote200"
class="citation">[200]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of this spring is generally acknowledged, and
it is matter of regret that proper accommodations for the
advantageous use of the water have not been more effectually
provided.&nbsp; A stone cistern, within a little shed, is the
only receptacle for the water, the refuse from which, after being
confined within a covered drain for a few yards, <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>flows into
the brook, and has produced an artificial morass, whose surface
(from the deposition of iron oxyd) is covered with an ochery
scum.</p>
<p>The care of the spring and baths is entrusted to the occupier
of a cottage on the spot.</p>
<p>On an elevated situation in an adjoining meadow stands the
primitive parish church of Sutton, a characteristic specimen of
the little Norman churches erected in villages.&nbsp; The west
front is crowned with a cupola, and displays a modern window, but
those on the other sides of the fabric are of the earliest kind,
narrowing towards the exterior surface of the wall.&nbsp; The
town may be regained by different routes over the meadows, which
lead to</p>
<h3>THE SUBURB OF COLEHAM,</h3>
<p>situated on the southern banks of the river, where the Meole
or Rea brook joins the Severn.&nbsp; This was until the present
century the lowest part of the town, and consequently most liable
to be inundated by floods; but of late years the street has been
raised about nine feet.</p>
<p>The township is populous, and consists of two districts,
called Longden Coleham and Meole Coleham from their respective
thoroughfares to those villages.&nbsp; In the latter direction is
Trinity Church, and in the former the extensive foundry of Mr.
Hazledine, where the iron-work used in the construction of that
surprising proof of human ingenuity, the &ldquo;Menai
Bridge,&rdquo; was cast, and proved by an engine whose pressure
was calculated at thirty-seven tons.</p>
<h2>TRADE AND MANUFACTURES.</h2>
<p>Our town for more than three centuries possessed almost
exclusively the trade with Wales in a coarse kind of cloth called
Welsh webs, which were brought from Merionethshire and
Montgomeryshire to a market held here <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>weekly.&nbsp; In reference to this,
Camden, in his &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; published in 1586, writes
of Shrewsbury&mdash;&ldquo;It is a fine city, well inhabited, and
of good commerce; and by the industry of the citizens and their
cloth manufacture and their trade with the Welsh, is very rich,
for hither the Welsh commodities are brought as to the common
mart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The termination of this branch of commerce is an event of too
much importance to be passed over.&nbsp; It is thus graphically
alluded to by Messrs. Owen and Blakeway: &ldquo;Every Thursday
the central parts of the town were all life and bustle; troops of
hardy ponies, each with a halter of twisted straw, and laden with
two bales of cloth, poured into the Market-place in the morning,
driven by stout Welshmen in their country coats of blue cloth and
striped linsey waistcoats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock the drapers, with their clerks and
shearmen, assembled under the Market-house, and proceeded up
stairs (according to ancient usage) in seniority.&nbsp; The
market being over, drays were seen in all directions conveying
the cloths to the several warehouses, and more than six hundred
pieces of web have been sold in a day.&nbsp; The whole was a
ready money business; and as the Welshmen left much of their cash
behind them in exchange for malt, groceries, and other shop
goods, the loss of such a trade to the town may be easily
conceived.&nbsp; This took place about the year 1795, and was
occasioned by individuals (not members of the Shrewsbury
fraternity of drapers) travelling into those parts where the
goods were made, from which the manufacturers soon learnt that
they might find a mart for their goods at home without the
trouble and expence of a journey to the walls of Amwythig.&nbsp;
In March, 1803, the company relinquished the great room over the
market-hall, where they had for nearly two centuries transacted
their business, and though much traffic in flannels was
subsequently <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>carried on in the town, the total extinction of this
branch of our local commerce is fast approaching, from the market
having diverged to Welshpool, Newtown, and Llanidloes, where the
advantages of machinery are now substituted for manual labour in
its manufacture.</p>
<p>The cessation of the woollen market in this town has been
ascribed to the improvement of the roads in Wales, which opened a
more free communication to the interlopers of the Drapers&rsquo;
company; and this again afforded some compensation to the town
for the loss of this branch of its trade.&nbsp; For if Shrewsbury
was no longer the emporium of North Wales, it was becoming the
centre of communication between London and Dublin; and the
agriculture of the neighbourhood and the trade of the town
received a new impulse from the vast increase of posting and
stage coaches, but far inadequate to the advantage which it
derived from its trade in Welsh woollens and the weekly visits of
the Cambrian farmers.</p>
<p>That Shrewsbury, however, may reap the full benefit of its
central situation as the great thoroughfare from whence all the
roads into North Wales diverge, and being also the general market
of the surrounding country, acknowledged to be one of the finest
agricultural districts in the kingdom, it is highly expedient
that our town should possess the advantage of a <span
class="smcap">Railway</span> communicating with the great lines
to Birmingham, London, Liverpool, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Prospectuses have been issued showing the eligibility of the
plan, and the position in which the trade and general intercourse
of the town will be placed if unprovided with those facilities of
cheap and expeditious conveyance enjoyed by other large towns;
and when it is considered that a great portion of the provisions
which supply the thickly-populated neighbourhoods of
Wolverhampton, Bilston, Birmingham, &amp;c. are purchased at our
weekly markets and <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>monthly fairs, and the deficient and expensive means of
transit on this line, a Railway would produce incalculable
benefit to the town by an increased traffic, and thereby
contribute to reinstate it in that important situation which it
once held as <span class="smcap">the Emporium of North
Wales</span>.</p>
<p>The chief manufactories at present are the extensive concern
of Messrs. Marshall for thread and linen yarns, three iron
foundries, and Messrs. Jones and Pidgeon&rsquo;s for tobacco and
snuff.&nbsp; The vicinity being a good barley country, the
malting business is carried on to a considerable extent, and
divided among sixty maltsters.&nbsp; Glass-staining has been
brought to the highest state of perfection in this town,
completely disproving assertions made some few years since that
the powers of this ancient science had then extended almost
beyond the hope of eventual excellence.&nbsp; The gothic chain,
however, which for so long a period had confined the mystery of
this beautiful art, once, indeed, considered as entirely lost,
has been effectively broken by our townsman, Mr. D. Evans, of
whose productions our churches and many other ecclesiastical
buildings and noblemen&rsquo;s mansions in different parts of the
kingdom afford specimens, contending in effect with some of the
finest works of the ancient masters.</p>
<p>Among the <i>delicacies</i> for which our town is so
deservedly celebrated may be mentioned a most delicious <span
class="smcap">Cake</span>, <a name="citation204"></a><a
href="#footnote204" class="citation">[204]</a> of which but few
strangers in passing through fail to partake, especially if they
have read the encomium of the poet Shenstone:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For here each season do these cakes
abide,<br />
Whose honoured names th&rsquo; inventive city own,<br />
Rend&rsquo;ring through Britain&rsquo;s isle Salopia&rsquo;s
praises known.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Shrewsbury Cakes</span> appear to have
been presented <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>to distinguished personages on their visit to this town
as early as the reign of Elizabeth; and when their Royal
Highnesses the Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria arrived
here in 1832, they were graciously pleased to accept a box of
them from the Mayor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Simnel</span> made here is much
admired, and great quantities of this kind of cake are prepared
about the season of Christmas and Lent.&nbsp; The word is
supposed to have been derived from the Latin <i>simila</i>,
signifying fine flour; but the common tradition fixes its origin
to a dispute between a man named &ldquo;Simon&rdquo; and his wife
&ldquo;Nell.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of them was desirous that the plum
pudding should be baked, while the other insisted that it should
be boiled: neither party being disposed to yield, it was
therefore first boiled and afterwards baked (the processes that
it now undergoes), and thus produced Sim-nell.&nbsp; The exterior
crust, or shell (enclosing a compound of fruit) is hard, and
deeply tinged with saffron.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Shrewsbury Brawn</span> is unrivalled,
and has lately been patronised by His Majesty William the
Fourth.&nbsp; Brawn is a Christmas dish of great antiquity, and
may be found in most of the ancient bills of fare for coronations
and other great feasts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brawn, mustard, and
malmsey&rdquo; were directed for breakfast during the reign of
Elizabeth; and Dugdale, in his account of the Inner Temple
Revels, states the same directions for that society.&nbsp; It is
prepared from the flesh of boars fattened for the purpose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Shrewsbury Ale</span> has been commended
from a remote period.&nbsp; <i>Iolo Goch</i>, the bard of Owen
Glendower, eulogises the profusion with which &ldquo;Cwrw
Amwythig,&rdquo; or Shrewsbury Ale, was dispensed in the mansion
of his hero at Sycarth, which he seems to have visited previously
to the insurrection of 1400.</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>In
the last century the properties of this beverage were thus
extolled:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hops, Water, and Barley, are here of the
best,<br />
Your March and October can well stand the test;<br />
The body is plump, and the visage ne&rsquo;er pale,<br />
That imbibes, or is painted, with <i>Shrewsbury
Ale</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>MARKETS.</h2>
<p>The market days are Wednesdays and Saturdays.&nbsp; The former
is small, but that on the latter day is well attended and
abundantly supplied.&nbsp; In fact, few towns enjoy the advantage
of a better or cheaper supply of meat, poultry, butter,
vegetables, fruit, &amp;c.&nbsp; But it must be confessed that
many places of far less importance than the capital of Shropshire
possess more suitable accommodations befitting the ample produce
brought from the surrounding districts to its markets.</p>
<p>The space allotted for the sale of vegetables is in the
spacious square opposite the County Hall, commonly called the
&ldquo;Green Market;&rdquo; that for poultry, eggs, &amp;c. on
Pride Hill and in the Butter Cross.&nbsp; The shambles for
butchers&rsquo; meat is in a street called &ldquo;the Double
Butcher Row;&rdquo; and in Fish-street, near St. Julian&rsquo;s
church, are sheds and stands for the country butchers.&nbsp; The
corn mart is held under the old market house.</p>
<h2>THE FAIRS.</h2>
<p>The fair for the sale of horses, cattle, butter, cheese,
&amp;c. is held on the second Wednesday in every month; and that
for sheep and pigs on the preceding day.&nbsp; It has long been
in contemplation to form a proper &ldquo;Smithfield&rdquo; for
cattle, &amp;c. which are now disposed of in the streets, much to
the annoyance of passengers.&nbsp; The wool fairs are in July and
August.</p>
<h2><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>THE
SEVERN.</h2>
<p>This beautiful stream, the queen of rivers,&mdash;famed in
British story and noticed by classic historians,&mdash;the theme
of poets and the admiration of tourists, is next in importance to
the Thames.</p>
<p>It rises in Plinlimmon mountain, Montgomeryshire, and pursues
its course through that county, receiving in its meanderings
numberless tributary streams, and presenting to proud Salopia the
richest variety of picturesque scenery.&nbsp; After winding sixty
or seventy miles through the centre of Shropshire, passing
Worcester, &amp;c. it at length becomes &ldquo;a mighty river,
potent, large,&rdquo; and empties itself into the Bristol
Channel, fifty miles below Gloucester.</p>
<h3>THE NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER</h3>
<p>is free for barges from thirty to eighty tons burden, during
the whole of its course throughout Shropshire, which are towed up
the stream by horses belonging to a company; but the navigation
is liable to interruption from high and rapid floods in winter,
and occasional want of depth of water in summer.</p>
<h2><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>THE
ENVIRONS OF SHREWSBURY</h2>
<p>Present an agreeable variety of pleasant drives and
interesting walks, unfolding from most points some changing
feature of landscape scenery, insulated, or grouped in
picturesque masses, and interspersed with lofty hills, which
afford an imposing back-ground to the town, producing a
succession of rich and varied prospects calculated to interest
the lover of nature, while the artist, the antiquary, the
botanist, or the geologist, may find an ample field for the
cultivation of their respective pursuits.</p>
<p>The limited plan of the present work will only admit of a very
brief notice of some of those objects that might claim the
attention of the enquiring stranger, or present themselves in the
course of a drive.</p>
<h3>BATTLEFIELD,</h3>
<p>Three miles N.E. by N. of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Perhaps few
events, so recent and of such importance in the annals of our
country, have left so few local traditions to awaken the dream of
ancient chivalry as the Battle of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The site of this momentous conflict for the crown of England
is no longer unenclosed, but seems thriving with the culture of
centuries of peace.&nbsp; Some armour and military weapons
occasionally turned up remind us of the event, or, but for the
Church piously founded by King Henry the Fourth, in commemoration
of his victory over Hotspur, Douglas, Worcester, and the rebel
army, we might rejoice that the breath of tranquillity has hushed
the tale of death.</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>The
many associations, however, connected with this event, are not
easily banished from the mind during a visit to this spot,
particularly when it is considered that it afforded matter for
the classic pen of Shakspeare.</p>
<h3>BATTLEFIELD CHURCH,</h3>
<p>According to the foundation of King Henry the Fourth,
consisted of five secular canons, and among other endowments
possessed the churches of St. Michael within the Castle of
Shrewsbury, and also St. Julian&rsquo;s, in the same town.&nbsp;
The clear annual revenues of the college at the dissolution being
&pound;54. 1s. 10d. as stated by Tanner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p209b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The fabric, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, stands in <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the centre
of a pasture field, and consists of a nave, chancel, and finely
proportioned tower, crowned with eight pinnacles and a richly
decorated frieze and parapet.&nbsp; The choral division, from the
style of the windows, was undoubtedly erected in the time of the
founder, and the western portion under the auspices of the Very
Reverend Adam Grafton, Dean of the Collegiate Church of St. Mary,
Shrewsbury, Archdeacon of Salop, &amp;c. &amp;c. a person of
great eminence in his day, and who possessed much architectural
taste.&nbsp; His name is inscribed on the east side of the tower
as warden of the college in 1504.&nbsp; Length of the church,
including the tower, 94 feet.</p>
<p>The roof of the nave and chancel having fallen in from decay
early in the last century, the latter was restored and supported
by four doric pillars.&nbsp; The interior is neat.</p>
<p>In the south wall is the piscina and the sedilia for the
officiating priests.&nbsp; In one of these is a curious wooden
figure, called &ldquo;Our Lady of Pity.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
represents the Virgin seated and bearing on her knees a dead
Christ.</p>
<p>The eastern window is of five divisions, and contains some
remains of the stained glass with which this church was once
enriched.&nbsp; The other portion having been taken down during a
repair of the fabric some years since, was either lost or
destroyed, through the negligence of the person to whom it was
entrusted.</p>
<p>The subjects comprised a history of the death of John the
Baptist, with various portraits of the knights who fell on the
King&rsquo;s side in the battle at this memorable place.&nbsp;
The crowned heads of King Henry the Fourth and his Queen, the
portraits of a bishop or abbot, and the head of John the Baptist
in a charger, may yet be distinguished, and are tastefully
pencilled.&nbsp; The red and yellow colours throughout are
particularly vivid.&nbsp; A beautiful border of <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>foliage,
with a mutilated inscription, is at the base of the window.</p>
<p>At the east end of the north wall is a handsome florid gothic
monument to the memory of the late John Corbet, Esq. of Sundorne,
who died in 1817.&nbsp; The basement is after the model of an
ancient altar tomb, from whence rises five panelled buttresses
with mouldings supporting the canopy, which consists of four
pointed ogee arches crocketed and crowned with finials.&nbsp; The
interior is a richly groined vault, and at the angles are small
turrets.&nbsp; The whole is beautifully worked in grained
free-stone from the neighbouring quarry of Grinshill.</p>
<p>The nave of the church is roofless: on each side are three
elegant mullioned windows, with tracery of different
devices.&nbsp; In the walls are corbels formed into grotesque
heads, on which rested the timbers that supported the roof.</p>
<p>The shaft of the ancient font (sunk in the ground) stands at
the north-east angle of the pointed arch which separates the nave
from the tower.&nbsp; The second floor of the tower is singularly
furnished with a fire-place, having a chimney formed within the
thickness of the wall and opening outside beneath the belfry
window.</p>
<p>A tabernacled niche above the chancel window contains the
crowned statue of Henry the Fourth: the right hand once sustained
a sword, and on the same side also hangs the scabbard.</p>
<p>The college stood at the east end of the church, the moat
which surrounded it being still visible.&nbsp; Near this part is
a field called the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Croft,&rdquo; in which
were placed a portion of the royal army.&nbsp; The troops of
Hotspur appear to have been chiefly stationed on the north
side.</p>
<p>On the south side of the church is a small cemetery, in which
is deposited the remains of the late Rev. Edward Williams, M.A.
who for nearly half a century was the <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>Minister of this parish&mdash;loved
and honoured by his flock as a spiritual father, and the
remembrance of whose virtues and christian instruction still
lingers like a lovely twilight.&nbsp; He died January 3d, 1833,
aged 70 years. <a name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212"
class="citation">[212]</a></p>
<h3>GRINSHILL</h3>
<p>Is four miles distant from hence.&nbsp; The village is
picturesquely sequestered beneath the extensive stone quarries,
of which great use has been made in the bridges, churches, and
public buildings of Salop.&nbsp; About the year 1630 a large
stone building was erected at this place for the reception of the
scholars under instruction at the Royal Free Grammar School
during the time any contagious disorder might prevail in the
town.&nbsp; It is now used as a private classical and commercial
school.</p>
<h3>HAWKSTONE,</h3>
<p>Being six miles further in this direction, is consequently
beyond the prescribed limit of my pen.&nbsp; I cannot forbear,
however, to remark that the scenery in the park is truly grand,
and the objects which meet the eye are varied and interesting,
consisting of a succession of hills and dales, rocks and caverns,
connected together in a comparatively small space.&nbsp; The
walks are twelve miles round, and the <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>obelisk erected on the terrace of
the park commands a prospect one hundred miles in diameter.</p>
<p>Amid this beautiful natural scene, the hand of art has
introduced many interesting features calculated to interrupt for
an interval the associations of the mind, that it might return
with renewed vigour and fresh delight to the enjoyment of the
more exalted feast of contemplative wonder, which nature has so
lavishly bestowed on this elysian spot.&nbsp; The noble
proprietor kindly permits visitors to gratify themselves with a
walk over the grounds.</p>
<h3>HAUGHMOND ABBEY,</h3>
<p>Three miles north-east of the town, is approached from the Old
Heath, by a road full of picturesque beauty.&nbsp; The vale is
watered by the Severn, while swelling hills fill up the
distance.</p>
<p>This monastery was founded in the year 1100 by William Fitz
Alan, for canons regular of St. Augustine, and is situated on the
side of a gentle eminence.&nbsp; The ruins form a most imposing
object, and are of sufficient consequence to attract the steps of
the pedestrian.&nbsp; Of the Abbey church few remains
exist.&nbsp; The door which opened into the cloister is an
elegant specimen of anglo-norman architecture.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Chapter House</span> is almost in a
perfect state of preservation: the front parallel with the
cloister consists of a fine entrance through a circular arch,
with a window in the same style on each side, divided into small
lights.&nbsp; The shafts of these arches have canopied niches
containing mutilated statues; the angel Gabriel, St. Catharine,
and St. John may yet be distinguished.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Abbott&rsquo;s Lodging</span> is in
part standing, being beyond the cloister and refectory
southward.&nbsp; There is likewise the shell of a noble hall,
having very early mullioned <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>windows, and a very large one at the
west end, the tracery of which is destroyed.&nbsp; At the
extremity of this was the great chamber, lighted by a beautiful
bow window (probably a later addition), and divided into an upper
and lower story.</p>
<p>On the north side of the Chapter House are two monumental
stones: the largest indicates the death of John Fitz Alan, Lord
of Clun, great-grandson of William, the founder of the monastery,
and the least that of his wife Isabel, daughter of Roger
Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore.</p>
<p>The revenues of this Abbey at the dissolution were, according
to Speed, &pound;294. 12s. 9d.&nbsp; The buildings were sold, and
converted into a spacious mansion.&nbsp; Haughmond demesne
comprises about 1100 acres, within which is situated the
castellated <span class="smcap">Mansion of Sundorne</span>, the
property of Mrs. Corbet.</p>
<p>South-east, clothed with masses of woody verdure, is</p>
<h3>HAUGHMOND HILL,</h3>
<p>the etymology of which is derived from <i>haut mont</i>, the
high mount.&nbsp; An easy ascent from the abbey leads to the
summit, from whence is a rich panoramic prospect over a portion
of the fertile vale of Shropshire, with the lofty steeples of its
ancient capital, and the blue mountains of Cambria in the
distance.</p>
<p>A castellated turret is erected on a steep crag of the hill,
down which the Scottish Earl Douglas leaped with his horse, on
being closely pursued after his escape from the Battle of
Shrewsbury, and received a severe injury.&nbsp; He was taken
prisoner, but the king, in admiration of his valour, set him at
liberty.</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill is</p>
<h3>THE VILLAGE OF UFFINGTON,</h3>
<p>which is delightfully situated, and affords many rural
beauties.&nbsp; <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>Here for a time the lover of nature may enjoy that calm
delight which moves the soul to contemplation; and whilst the eye
has been charmed with the prospect enjoyed from the summit of the
adjoining eminence, the heart seems hushed to the noise of a
populous town, and a feeling of tranquillity imperceptibly steals
upon the mind, for which a cause can scarcely be assigned.</p>
<p>Parties from the town are often tempted by the beauty of the
situation to make this place a holiday retreat, whose enjoyment
is enhanced by the accommodations of a good inn, attached to
which, above the banks of the Severn, is a pleasant bowling
green.</p>
<p>The church, overshaded by two venerable yews, possesses a
primitive simplicity, quite in character with the village.</p>
<h3>THE VILLAGE OF ALBRIGHTON,</h3>
<p>distant three miles N.E. of the town on the Chester road, is a
township in the parish of St. Mary, Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The church,
a small humble structure, has been so effectually repaired by the
modern goths with red stone and brick, that no reasonable
conjecture can now be formed as to the period of its
erection.&nbsp; A wooden loft issues from the west end, and
inside the building is a curious ancient font, that will admit of
total immersion, which has no doubt stood here for several
centuries.</p>
<p>The fine old mansion near the church was formerly the
residence of the ancient family of Ireland, who purchased this
manor <a name="citation215"></a><a href="#footnote215"
class="citation">[215]</a> on the dissolution of Shrewsbury
Abbey.</p>
<p>A bridle road across a field leads to Albright Hussey and
Battlefield.&nbsp; The former was the moated mansion of the
Husseys, Barkers, and Corbets, but is now converted into a farm
house.&nbsp; Here was a chapel, dedicated to Saint <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>John the
Baptist, as appears by the grant of the land on which Battlefield
church stands from Henry IV. to Roger Ive, of Leaton, who is
there described as rector of the chapel of St. John the Baptist
at Albright Hussey, and which chapel was by the said grant for
ever annexed to the collegiate church of Battlefield; and Richard
Hussey and his heirs were to be perpetual patrons of the
same.&nbsp; The only vestige of the chapel is an old arch in a
barn called the &ldquo;chapel barn.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE VILLAGE OF MEOLE,</h3>
<p>otherwise Meole Brace, is one mile south of the town. <a
name="citation216"></a><a href="#footnote216"
class="citation">[216]</a>&nbsp; The church stands on a little
knoll above the Rea brook, and was erected on the site of an
ancient edifice in the year 1800.&nbsp; It is a plain cruciform
building, with a tower rising from the roof at the west end.</p>
<p>From this place many agreeable walks branch off in the
direction of Kingsland, Sutton, and the Sharpstones.&nbsp; Near
the latter place, at Bayston Hill, is an earthwork of an
irregular form, which seems to have been surrounded on all sides
but the east by two fosses, the abrupt formation of the ground in
that direction rendering such a protection unnecessary.&nbsp; The
entrance was no doubt from the Stretton road at the west.&nbsp;
The <i>double</i> entrenchment admits a probability that it
belonged to the Anglo-Saxons, but it is <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>difficult
to distinguish between their encampments and those of the Danes,
both forming their camps nearly alike and on elevated
spots.&nbsp; The present site possesses every advantage for a
military post of observation to the adjoining country.&nbsp; The
residents in the vicinity designate it by the common appellation
of the &ldquo;Buries,&rdquo; and which appears to have escaped
the notice of former topographers.</p>
<p>Two miles beyond this spot is the pleasant</p>
<h3>VILLAGE OF CONDOVER.</h3>
<p>The church is a spacious building, displaying examples of
early Norman architecture.&nbsp; It contains several handsome
monuments in memory of the ancient family of Owen, among which
one from the chisel of Roubiliac is considered a remarkably fine
production.&nbsp; The adjoining mansion, a most interesting
specimen of the Elizabethan style of building, was erected by Sir
Thomas Owen, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who
died in 1598.&nbsp; Within the hall is the finest collection of
paintings in the county.&nbsp; This village was the birth-place
of Richard Tarlton, the earliest English comedian of celebrity,
who for his surprisingly pleasant extemporaneous wit, as an actor
and jester, was the wonder of his time.&nbsp; Fuller states, that
&ldquo;when Queen Elizabeth was serious and out of good humour,
he could undumpish her at his pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a free
and eccentric life, it is said he died penitent in 1588.</p>
<h3>PITCHFORD,</h3>
<p>six miles south-east of the town, takes its name from a kind
of mineral pitch, which exudes out of a red sand stone, from
which an oil is extracted called British oil.&nbsp; A similar
substance is also found at this place, floating on a spring of
water.&nbsp; Pitchford Hall is a beautiful specimen of the
half-timbered <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>mansion erected during the sixteenth century, and is
the property of the Right Hon. the Earl of Liverpool, a
descendant maternally of the Ottley family, one of whom purchased
the estate in 1473.</p>
<p>The church, erected in the reign of Henry I. is a specimen of
the lesser Anglo-Norman edifices erected in villages.&nbsp; Its
foundation throws some light on the formation of our parochial
establishments and the nature of tithes.</p>
<p>It appears that previously to its erection the inhabitants of
the lordship went to some of the surrounding churches to hear
divine service and receive the sacraments, and gave their tithes
where they chose.&nbsp; Many of them contributed their tithes to
the dean and chapter of St. Chad, in Salop, on condition that
they found a chaplain and clerk, who should perform service three
times a week, and daily visit the sick and baptize infants; but
these duties being much neglected, one Ralph lord of Pitchford,
moved by &ldquo;charity and zeal,&rdquo; built a church at his
own expence, and formed a certain district as the boundary of the
parish.</p>
<p>At the distance of somewhat more than a mile is</p>
<h3>ACTON BURNELL.</h3>
<p>The remains of the ancient castle, founded by Robert Burnell,
Bishop of Bath and Wells, consist of a large building, with a
square tower at each angle.&nbsp; To this place the parliament of
Shrewsbury adjourned in 1283, where were passed (and received the
royal assent) certain legislative regulations, and amongst these
the act touching merchant debtors, called &ldquo;Statutum de
Mercatoribus,&rdquo; designated likewise the Statute of Acton
Burnell.&nbsp; The church is cruciform, and in the pointed style
of the fourteenth century, having a wooden tower in the
centre.&nbsp; Near this village is the seat of Sir Edward Joseph
Smythe, Bart. and the grounds of the park are beautiful and
extensive.</p>
<h3><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>THE
VILLAGE OF ATCHAM,</h3>
<p>Three miles and a half east of the town, is delightfully
seated on the banks of the Severn, over which there is a handsome
bridge of seven arches, designed by Mr. Gwyn, a native of
Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The etymology of the place seems to be derived from
<i>Eatta</i>, a Saxon saint to whom the parish church is
dedicated.&nbsp; It was anciently called Ettingeham and
Attingesham.&nbsp; In the Saxon period it belonged to the college
of St. Alkmund, Shrewsbury; and when that church was annexed to
Lilleshull Abbey, the advowson of Atcham made part of the
transfer.</p>
<p>The present edifice consists of a nave without aisles; the
predominant styles of the windows may be attributed to the
fifteenth century; some of them are decorated with stained

<p>The basement of the tower is early Norman, and flanked with
broad shallow buttresses.&nbsp; The portal at the west is a
deeply recessed round arch, resting on five slender pillars on
each side; above is an early lancet window, over which is another
of smaller dimensions, bisected by a short pillar into narrow
lights.&nbsp; The superstructure of the tower (like <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>many others
in the vicinity) is of the sixteenth century, and was once
crowned with eight pinnacles, the remains of which are now only
visible above the frieze of the battlements.</p>
<p>The village is remarkable as being the birth-place of
Ordericus, the earliest Salopian historian.&nbsp; He was the son
of Odelerius Constantius, of Orleans, a chief councillor to Roger
de Montgomery, born (as he informs us) Feb. 16, 1075, &ldquo;and
on the Easter Sunday following was baptised by Ordericus the
priest at Ettingesham, in the church of St. Eatta the
Confessor,&rdquo; and received the rudiments of his education
under Siward the priest, in the little church of St. Peter,
Shrewsbury, on the site of which the stately Benedictine abbey
was afterwards built.&nbsp; Ordericus&rsquo;s great work is
entitled an &ldquo;Ecclesiastical History,&rdquo; but is more
properly a record of the events of his own time.</p>
<p>Atcham once had the privilege of a fair, and the inhabitants
were styled burgesses.</p>
<p>Opposite the inn, a pleasant drive leads through the village
of Uffington, by which Shrewsbury may be regained.&nbsp;
Continuing our course for half a mile on the London road, we pass
over <span class="smcap">Tern Bridge</span>, below which the
river Tern fells into the Severn.&nbsp; On the left, <span
class="smcap">Attingham Hall</span>, the elegant mansion of the
Right Hon. Lord Berwick, with its lofty portico, forms a bold and
imposing object, and its beautiful situation near the confluence
of the rivers Tern and Severn, imparts an additional charm to the
surrounding scenery.&nbsp; To the right is</p>
<h3>WROXETER.</h3>
<p>This village was the metropolis of the <i>Cornavii</i>, a
tribe of Britons settled in Shropshire and some of the adjoining
counties at the period when Julius C&aelig;sar first invaded this
island.&nbsp; On the subjugation of the Britons this place <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>became the
flourishing Roman station of Uriconium,&mdash;Wriconium,
synonymous with the adjoining Wrekin, <a
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a>&mdash;subsequently Wrekincester, and
by contraction Wroxeter.</p>
<p>It is situated on a gentle eminence above the Severn,
possessing those advantages which the Romans generally kept in
view, viz. dryness of soil, extensive prospect, and the
protection of a river.&nbsp; From the almost impenetrable
obscurity in which its early history is involved, no adequate
idea can now be formed of the pristine state of this interesting
place.</p>
<p>The town was undoubtedly defended by a wall and ditch, the
boundaries of which are still to be traced throughout a
circumference of three miles.</p>
<p>According to the best writers, we find that the Romans
entirely quitted Britain about the middle of the fifth century,
on which the Britons continued to occupy this place (deserted by
their former masters) until they were ejected from it by the
superior force of the Saxons sometime in the following century,
and obliged to find a retreat among &ldquo;the alders and willows
which hid the foot and the thickets which crowned the summit of
the peninsular knoll, now covered by the capital of
Shropshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long the fugitives remained at Caer Pengwern unmolested it
is now in vain to enquire, but this appears certain, that they
were soon followed thither by the unsparing Saxons, and compelled
to seek another refuge in the mountain fastnesses of Wales.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt but the fall of Wroxeter was, as Leland
asserts, &ldquo;the cause of the erection of Shrewsbury;&rdquo;
<a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and from
the blackness of the soil in some parts its destruction seems to
have been by fire; many of the coins also, and other remains
discovered here, exhibit marks of their having been subjected to
that element: in fact, the savage ferocity of the Saxon
conquerors in their warfare, together with their ascendancy over
the Britons, was so determinate and effectual in the demolition
of those stations which they held, that little surprise need be
excited so few vestiges remain of the Roman provinces in this
kingdom, or of the many works of art which that nation doubtless
left on their departure.</p>
<p>The Saxons on their invasion wielded fire and sword
unsparingly.&nbsp; It was their practice, on gaining possession
of a town or city, immediately to level it with the ground; and
it is recorded, that one of these triumphant barbarians boasted
that in three days after he has galloped his horse without
stumbling over the spot on which the captured station stood.</p>
<p>Wroxeter will be regarded by the antiquary with curious
attention, as affording matter of much investigation: indeed it
is impossible, even in imagination, to look upon its fruitful
fields, teeming in the rich luxuriance of culture,&mdash;once
covered with a flourishing Roman town,&mdash;now presenting only
the ruined remnant of a wall, without sensibly feeling the
instability of human greatness, and exclaiming with
Cowper&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>We turn to dust, and all our mightiest works<br />
Die too.&nbsp; The deep foundations that we lay,<br />
Time ploughs them up, and not a trace remains.<br />
We build with what we call eternal rock:&mdash;<br />
A distant age asks where the fabric stood;<br />
And in the dust, sifted and search&rsquo;d in vain,<br />
The undiscoverable secret sleeps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ruined wall still remaining is about 70 feet long <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>and 28 feet
high, and is composed of layers of rough stones and large flat
tiles at alternate distances.&nbsp; It is arched, and the
interior thickness is formed with rubble and small pebbles thrown
in with the cement or mortar, which is become harder than
stone.&nbsp; This venerable relic is thought to have been a
portion of the fortification of the town.&nbsp; Other conjectures
are, that it might have been connected with the Pr&aelig;torium,
or have been part of a bath, which was discovered at no great
distance from it; but after a lapse probably of more than 1600
years, and where evidence is wanting to guide us, its original
purpose must remain in uncertainty.</p>
<p>Tesselated pavements, sepulchral stones with inscriptions,
urns, skeletons in deep graves and encased in red clay, several
moulds for coining money, seals of different kinds, an Apollo
(four inches in length) elegantly cast in lead, with other
figures, and many curious and interesting remains of Roman
manufacture, have been discovered whilst excavating on this
site.&nbsp; A stone altar, found near the vicarage in 1824, is
thus inscribed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">BONO REI<br />
PVBLICAE<br />
NATVS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great quantities of copper coins, and many of gold and silver,
are constantly turned up by the plough.&nbsp; The copper coins
are chiefly of the lower empire.</p>
<p>The town was situated on the line of the Watling Street road,
in the direction towards Stretton.&nbsp; In the ford across the
Severn the foundations of a bridge may be discerned at low
water.</p>
<p>Near this spot a discovery was made at the end of the last
century, which no doubt denoted the burial-place of some family
of distinction resident at this colony.&nbsp; It consisted of an
enclosure of large stones a little below the surface of the
ground, within which were deposited three <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>large urns
composed of a beautiful transparent green glass, each having one
handle elegantly ribbed, and severally containing burnt bones and
a glass lachrymatory.&nbsp; Some earthen urns, an earthen lamp,
and a few Roman coins, were also found at the same place, the
whole being covered with large flat stones.</p>
<p>The village church, on the accession of Henry II. was granted
to the canons of Haghmond Abbey, and is an edifice deserving of
attention, displaying in its construction several specimens of
architecture between the earliest Anglo-Norman and the
incongruous reparations of the last century.&nbsp; The building
consists of a nave and chancel; in the latter is a curious
doorway, and the former seems to have had originally a south
aisle.&nbsp; The tower was probably erected in the reign of Henry
the Eighth.</p>
<p>In the church are three handsome altar tombs, bearing
full-length cumbent effigies of Lord Chief Justice Bromley, who
died May 15, 1555, and Isabel his wife; Sir Richarde Newporte,
Knyghte (Queen&rsquo;s Counsel in the Marches of Wales), and
Margaret his wife, only daughter of the Lord Chief Justice; and
John Berker, of Haghmond Abbey, Esq. and Margaret his wife,
second daughter of Sir Francis Newport, Knt. who died in
1618.</p>
<p>In 1824 these were judiciously restored and beautified.&nbsp;
In addition to which there are mural monuments, with
inscriptions, commemorative of Francis, Viscount Newport and Earl
of Bradford, who died Sept. 19, 1708; also the Hon. Andrew
Newport, his brother; and a tablet to the memory of Andrew
Newport, <i>utter</i> barrister, who died in 1611.</p>
<p>The vicinity of Wroxeter affords a delightful display of
pastoral beauty,&mdash;the bright river, with every other
requisite for the finest landscape scenery.</p>

will, or by the zeal of his surviving friends, that the popish
service should not be celebrated over his remains, which were in
consequence buried in his own garden, over which a plain altar
has been erected, with a quaint poetical inscription.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
